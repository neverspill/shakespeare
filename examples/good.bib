abstract = {The continuous increase in capacity of non-volatile data storage systems will lead to bit densities of one bit per atom in 2020. Beyond this point, capacity can be increased by moving into the third dimension. We propose to use self-assembly of nanosized elements, either as a loosely organised associative network or into a cross-point architecture. When using principles requiring electrical connection, we show the need for transistor-based cross-talk isolation. Cross-talk can be avoided by reusing the coincident current magnetic ring core memory architecture invented in 1953. We demonstrate that self-assembly of three-dimensional ring core memories is in principle possible by combining corner lithography and anisotropic etching into single crystal silicon.},

abstract = {Research investigating the origins of life usually focuses on exploring possible life-bearing chemistries in the pre-biotic Earth, or else on synthetic approaches. Little work has been done exploring fundamental issues concerning the spontaneous emergence of life using only concepts (such as information and evolution) that are divorced from any particular chemistry. Here, I advocate studying the probability of spontaneous molecular self-replication as a function of the information contained in the replicator, and the environmental conditions that might enable this emergence. I show that (under certain simplifying assumptions) the probability to discover a self-replicator by chance depends exponentially on the rate of formation of the monomers. If the rate at which monomers are formed is somewhat similar to the rate at which they would occur in a self-replicating polymer, the likelihood to discover such a replicator by chance is increased by many orders of magnitude. I document such an increase in searches for a self-replicator within the digital life system avida},

abstract = {Monodisperse polyhedral nanocrystals with O(h) (octahedral) symmetry self-assemble into various mesophases and crystal structures at intermediate and high concentrations. In this work, the effect of quenched size polydispersity on phase and jamming behavior has been studied via molecular simulations for three representative O(h) polyhedral shapes; namely, cubes, cuboctahedrons, and truncated octahedrons. Polydispersity is set by the standard deviation "$\delta$" of an underlying Gaussian distribution of particle sizes, and is "quenched" in that it is fixed in a given uniphase sample. Quenched polydisperse states are relevant to: (i) equilibrium behavior for small enough $\delta$ when phase segregation does not occur, and (ii) actual experimental behavior for arbitrary $\delta$ when dense states are reached at a rate faster than the relaxation of slow diffusion-driven fractionation modes. Space-filling polyhedrons (cubes and truncated octahedrons) are found to be more robust with respect to the nucleation of orientational and translational order at high polydispersities compared to the non-space-filling cuboctahedron, with the former shapes exhibiting an onset of jamming behavior at a critical polydispersity $\delta$(t) that is about twice larger than that for the latter ($\delta$(t) ≈ 0.08). Further, the orientational ordering in cubes is found to be highly resilient to polydispersity, leading to the formation of a dense, orientationally aligned, and translationally jammed state. Overall, increasing size polydispersity enhances the range of pressures where the mesophases occur.},

abstract = {Translational and orientational excluded-volume fields encoded in particles with anisotropic shapes can lead to purely entropy-driven assembly of morphologies with specific order and symmetry. To elucidate this complex correlation, we carried out detailed Monte Carlo simulations of six convex space-filling polyhedrons, namely, truncated octahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, hexagonal prisms, cubes, gyrobifastigiums and triangular prisms. Simulations predict the formation of various new liquid-crystalline and plastic-crystalline phases at intermediate volume fractions. By correlating these findings with particle anisotropy and rotational symmetry, simple guidelines for predicting phase behaviour of polyhedral particles are proposed: high rotational symmetry is in general conducive to mesophase formation, with low anisotropy favouring plastic-solid behaviour and intermediate anisotropy (or high uniaxial anisotropy) favouring liquid-crystalline behaviour. It is also found that dynamical disorder is crucial in defining mesophase behaviour, and that the apparent kinetic barrier for the liquid-mesophase transition is much lower for liquid crystals (orientational order) than for plastic solids (translational order).},

abstract = {The glassy states of water are of common interest as the majority of H2O in space is in the glassy state and especially because a proper description of this phenomenon is considered to be the key to our understanding why liquid water shows exceptional properties, different from all other liquids. The occurrence of water's calorimetric glass transition of low-density amorphous ice at 136 K has been discussed controversially for many years because its calorimetric signature is very feeble. Here, we report that high-density amorphous ice at ambient pressure shows a distinct calorimetric glass transitions at 116 K and present evidence that this second glass transition involves liquid-like translational mobility of water molecules. This "double Tg scenario" is related to the coexistence of two liquid phases. The calorimetric signature of the second glass transition is much less feeble, with a heat capacity increase at Tg,2 about five times as large as at Tg,1. By using broadband-dielectric spectroscopy we resolve loss peaks yielding relaxation times near 100 s at 126 K for low-density amorphous ice and at 110 K for high-density amorphous ice as signatures of these two distinct glass transitions. Temperature-dependent dielectric data and heating-rate-dependent calorimetric data allow us to construct the relaxation map for the two distinct phases of water and to extract fragility indices m = 14 for the low-density and m = 20-25 for the high-density liquid. Thus, low-density liquid is classified as the strongest of all liquids known ("superstrong"), and also high-density liquid is classified as a strong liquid.},

We reproduce results of serial high-precision Monte Carlo runs to verify the method. This is a good test case because the hard disk equation of state over the range where the liquid transforms into the solid is particularly sensitive to small deviations away from the balance conditions. On a GeForce GTX 680, our GPU implementation executes 95 times faster than on a single Intel Xeon E5540 CPU core, enabling 17 times better performance per dollar and cutting energy usage by a factor of 10.},

This large number allows us to resolve extremely low nucleation rates, and also provides excellent statistics for cluster properties over a wide range of cluster sizes. The nucleation rates, cluster growth rates, and size distributions are presented in Diemand et al. [J. Chem. Phys. \{$\backslash$bf 139\}, 74309 (2013)], while this paper analyses the properties of the clusters. We explore the cluster temperatures, density profiles, potential energies and shapes. A thorough understanding of the properties of the clusters is crucial to the formulation of nucleation models. Significant latent heat is retained by stable clusters, by as much as \$\backslash Delta kT = 0.1 \backslash epsilon\$ for clusters with size \$i = 100\$. We find that the clusters deviate remarkably from spherical - with ellipsoidal axis ratios for critical cluster sizes typically within \$b/c = 0.7\backslash pm 0.05\$ and \$a/c = 0.5 \backslash pm 0.05\$. We examine cluster spin angular momentum, and find that it plays a negligible role in the cluster dynamics. The interfaces of large, stable clusters are thiner than planar equilibrium interfaces by \$10-30\backslash\%\$. At the critical cluster size, the cluster central densities are between \$5-30\backslash\%\$ lower than the bulk liquid expectations. These lower densities imply larger-than-expected surface areas, which increase the energy cost to form a surface, which lowers nucleation rates.},

The resulting algorithms have the capacity to simulate a wide range of spatio-temporal scales in spatially distributed, non-equilibrium physiochemical processes with complex chemistry and transport micro-mechanisms. The algorithms can be tailored to specific hierarchical parallel architectures such as multi-core processors or clusters of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The proposed parallel algorithms are controlled-error approximations of kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms, departing from the predominant paradigm of creating parallel KMC algorithms with exactly the same master equation as the serial one. Our methodology relies on a spatial decomposition of the Markov operator underlying the KMC algorithm into a hierarchy of operators corresponding to the processors' structure in the parallel architecture. Based on this operator decomposition, we formulate Fractional Step Approximation schemes by employing the Trotter Theorem and its random variants; these schemes, (a) determine the communication schedule between processors, and (b) are run independently on each processor through a serial KMC simulation, called a kernel, on each fractional step time-window. Furthermore, the proposed mathematical framework allows us to rigorously justify the numerical and statistical consistency of the proposed algorithms, showing the convergence of our approximating schemes to the original serial KMC. The approach also provides a systematic evaluation of different processor communicating schedules.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles with unconventional shapes may exhibit different types of assembly architectures that depend critically on the environmental conditions under which they are formed. Here, we demonstrate how the presence of polymer (polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA) molecules in a solution in which CdSe(core)/CdS (pods) octapods are initially dispersed affects the octapod-polymer organization upon solvent evaporation. We show that a fast drop-drying process can induce a remarkable two-dimensional (2D) self-assembly of octapods at the polymer/air interface. In the resulting structure, each octapod is oriented like a "ballerina", i.e., only one pod sticks out of the polymer film and is perpendicular to the polymer-air interface, while the opposite pod (with respect to the octapod's center) is fully immersed in the film and points towards the substrate. In some areas, a hexagonal-like pattern is formed by the "ballerinas", in which the six non-vertical pods, which are all embedded in the film, maintain a pod-pod parallel configuration with respect to neighboring particles. We hypothesize that the mechanism responsible for such a self-assembly is based on a fast adsorption of the octapods from bulk solution to the droplet/air interface during the early stages of solvent evaporation. At this interface, the octapods maintain enough rotational freedom to organize mutually in a pod-pod parallel configuration between neighboring octapods. As the solvent evaporates, the octapods form a ballerina-rich octapod-polymer composite, in which the octapods are in close contact with the substrate. Finally, we found that the resulting octapod-polymer composite is less hydrophilic than the polymer-only film.},

We show that, even though granular particles are distinguishable, we have to include a factor \$1/N!\$ to ensure that the entropy does not change when exchanging particles between systems in the same macroscopic state. Our simulations provide strong evidence that the packing entropy, when properly defined, is extensive. As different packings are created with unequal probabilities, it is natural to express the packing entropy as \$S=-\backslash sum\_i p\_i\backslash ln p\_i -\backslash ln N!\$, where \$p\_i\$ denotes the probability to generate the \$i\$-th packing. We can compute this quantity reliably and it is also extensive. The granular entropy thus (re)defined, whilst distinct from the one proposed by Edwards assumed (J.

@article{Auer2001,
abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Crystallization is a fundamental and ubiquitous process much studied over the centuries. But although the crystallization of atoms is fairly well understood, it remains challenging to predict reliably the outcome of molecular crystallization processes that are complicated by various molecular interactions and solvent involvement. This difficulty also applies to nanoparticles: high-quality three-dimensional crystals are mostly produced using drying and sedimentation techniques that are often impossible to rationalize and control to give a desired crystal symmetry, lattice spacing and habit (crystal shape). In principle, DNA-mediated assembly of nanoparticles offers an ideal opportunity for studying nanoparticle crystallization: a well-defined set of rules have been developed to target desired lattice symmetries and lattice constants, and the occurrence of features such as grain boundaries and twinning in DNA superlattices and traditional crystals comprised of molecular or atomic building blocks suggests that similar principles govern their crystallization. But the presence of charged biomolecules, interparticle spacings of tens of nanometres, and the realization so far of only polycrystalline DNA-interconnected nanoparticle superlattices, all suggest that DNA-guided crystallization may differ from traditional crystal growth. Here we show that very slow cooling, over several days, of solutions of complementary-DNA-modified nanoparticles through the melting temperature of the system gives the thermodynamic product with a specific and uniform crystal habit. We find that our nanoparticle assemblies have the Wulff equilibrium crystal structure that is predicted from theoretical considerations and molecular dynamics simulations, thus establishing that DNA hybridization can direct nanoparticle assembly along a pathway that mimics atomic crystallization.},

abstract = {A quantitative understanding of nanocrystal phase transformations would enable more efficient energy conversion and catalysis, but has been hindered by difficulties in directly monitoring well-characterized nanoscale systems in reactive environments. We present a new in situ luminescence-based probe enabling direct quantification of nanocrystal phase transformations, applied here to the hydriding transformation of palladium nanocrystals. Our approach reveals the intrinsic kinetics and thermodynamics of nanocrystal phase transformations, eliminating complications of substrate strain, ligand effects and external signal transducers. Clear size-dependent trends emerge in nanocrystals long accepted to be bulk-like in behaviour. Statistical mechanical simulations show these trends to be a consequence of nanoconfinement of a thermally driven, first-order phase transition: near the phase boundary, critical nuclei of the new phase are comparable in size to the nanocrystal itself. Transformation rates are then unavoidably governed by nanocrystal dimensions. Our results provide a general framework for understanding how nanoconfinement fundamentally impacts broad classes of thermally driven solid-state phase transformations relevant to hydrogen storage, catalysis, batteries and fuel cells.},

abstract = {To better understand the self-assembly of small molecules and nanoparticles adsorbed at interfaces, we have performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice model based on the seven hard "tetrominoes", connected shapes that occupy four lattice sites. The equations of state of the pure fluids and all of the binary mixtures are determined over a wide range of density, and a large selection of multicomponent mixtures are also studied at selected conditions. Calculations are performed in the grand canonical ensemble and are analogous to real systems in which molecules or nanoparticles reversibly adsorb to a surface or interface from a bulk reservoir. The model studied is athermal; objects in these simulations avoid overlap but otherwise do not interact. As a result, all of the behavior observed is entropically driven. The one-component fluids all exhibit marked self-ordering tendencies at higher densities, with quite complex structures formed in some cases. Significant clustering of objects with the same rotational state (orientation) is also observed in some of the pure fluids. In all of the binary mixtures, the two species are fully miscible at large scales, but exhibit strong species-specific clustering (segregation) at small scales. This behavior persists in multicomponent mixtures; even in seven-component mixtures of all the shapes there is significant association between objects of the same shape. To better understand these phenomena, we calculate the second virial coefficients of the tetrominoes and related quantities, extract thermodynamic volume of mixing data from the simulations of binary mixtures, and determine Henry's law solubilities for each shape in a variety of solvents. The overall picture obtained is one in which complementarity of both the shapes of individual objects and the characteristic structures of different fluids are important in determining the overall behavior of a fluid of a given composition, with sometimes counterintuitive results. Finally, we note that no sharp phase transitions are observed but that this appears to be due to the small size of the objects considered. It is likely that complex phase behavior may be found in systems of larger polyominoes.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that homogeneous monodisperse rods in the presence of attractive interactions assemble into equilibrium 2D fluid-like membranes composed of a one-rod length thick monolayer of aligned rods. Unique features of our system allow us to simultaneously investigate properties of these membranes at both continuum and molecular lengthscales. Analysis of thermal fluctuations at continuum lengthscales yields the membranes' lateral compressibility and bending rigidity and demonstrates that the properties of colloidal membranes are comparable to those of traditional lipid bilayers. Fluctuations at molecular lengthscales, in which single rods protrude from the membrane surface, are directly measured by comparing the positions of individual fluorescently labeled rods within a membrane to that of the membrane's continuum conformation. As two membranes approach each other in suspension, protrusion fluctuations are suppressed leading to effective repulsive interactions. Motivated by these observations, we propose an entropic mechanism that explains the stability of colloidal membranes and offers a general design principle for the self-assembly of 2D nanostructured materials from rod-like molecules.},

abstract = {Focal conic domains (FCDs) in smectic-A liquid crystals have drawn much attention, both for their exquisitely structured internal form and for their ability to direct the assembly of micromaterials and nanomaterials in a variety of patterns. A key to directing FCD assembly is control over the eccentricity of the domain. Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm for creating spatially varying FCD eccentricity by confining a hybrid-aligned smectic with curved interfaces. In particular, we manipulate interface behavior with colloidal particles in order to experimentally produce two examples of what has recently been dubbed the flower texture [C. Meyer et al., Focal Conic Stacking in Smectic A Liquid Crystals: Smectic Flower and Apollonius Tiling, Materials 2, 499, 2009], where the focal hyperbol\ae diverge radially outward from the center of the texture, rather than inward as in the canonical \'{e}ventail or fan texture. We explain how this unconventional assembly can arise from appropriately curved interfaces. Finally, we present a model for this system that applies the law of corresponding cones, showing how FCDs may be embedded smoothly within a “background texture” of large FCDs and concentric spherical layers, in a manner consistent with the qualitative features of the smectic flower. Such understanding could potentially lead to disruptive liquid-crystal technologies beyond displays, including patterning, smart surfaces, microlens arrays, sensors, and nanomanufacturing.},

abstract = {Organic chemistry on a planetary scale is likely to have transformed carbon dioxide and reduced carbon species delivered to an accreting Earth. According to various models for the origin of life on Earth, biological molecules that jump-started Darwinian evolution arose via this planetary chemistry. The grandest of these models assumes that ribonucleic acid (RNA) arose prebiotically, together with components for compartments that held it and a primitive metabolism that nourished it. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to identify possible prebiotic chemistry that might have created RNA. Organic molecules, given energy, have a well-known propensity to form multiple products, sometimes referred to collectively as "tar" or "tholin." These mixtures appear to be unsuited to support Darwinian processes, and certainly have never been observed to spontaneously yield a homochiral genetic polymer. To date, proposed solutions to this challenge either involve too much direct human intervention to satisfy many in the community, or generate molecules that are unreactive "dead ends" under standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Carbohydrates, organic species having carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in a ratio of 1:2:1 and an aldehyde or ketone group, conspicuously embody this challenge. They are components of RNA and their reactivity can support both interesting spontaneous chemistry as part of a "carbohydrate world," but they also easily form mixtures, polymers and tars. We describe here the latest thoughts on how on this challenge, focusing on how it might be resolved using minerals containing borate, silicate, and molybdate, inter alia.},

abstract = {Despite intense research efforts by research groups worldwide, the potential of self-assembled nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) has not been realized due to an incomplete understanding of the fundamental molecular interactions governing the self-assembly process. Because NCSLs reside naturally at length-scales between atomic crystals and colloidal assemblies, synthetic control over the properties of constituent nanocrystal (NC) building blocks and their coupling in ordered assemblies is expected to yield a new class of materials with remarkable optical, electronic, and vibrational characteristics. Progress toward the formation of suitable test structures and subsequent development of NCSL-based technologies has been held back by the limited control over superlattice spacing and symmetry. Here we show that NCSL symmetry can be controlled by manipulating molecular interactions between ligands bound to the NC surface and the surrounding solvent. Specifically, we demonstrate solvent vapor-mediated NCSL symmetry transformations that are driven by the orientational ordering of NCs within the lattice. The assembly of various superlattice polymorphs, including face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and body-centered tetragonal (bct) structures, is studied in real time using in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) under controlled solvent vapor exposure. This approach provides quantitative insights into the molecular level physics that controls solvent-ligand interactions and assembly of NCSLs. Computer simulations based on all-atom molecular dynamics techniques confirm several key insights gained from experiment.},

abstract = {Colloidal particles with directional interactions are key in the realization of new colloidal materials with possibly unconventional phase behaviors. Here we exploit DNA self-assembly to produce bulk quantities of "DNA stars" with three or four sticky terminals, mimicking molecules with controlled limited valence. Solutions of such molecules exhibit a consolution curve with an upper critical point, whose temperature and concentration decrease with the valence. Upon approaching the critical point from high temperature, the intensity of the scattered light diverges with a power law, whereas the intensity time autocorrelation functions show a surprising two-step relaxation, somehow reminiscent of glassy materials. The slow relaxation time exhibits an Arrhenius behavior with no signs of criticality, demonstrating a unique scenario where the critical slowing down of the concentration fluctuations is subordinate to the large lifetime of the DNA bonds, with relevant analogies to critical dynamics in polymer solutions. The combination of equilibrium and dynamic behavior of DNA nanostars demonstrates the potential of DNA molecules in diversifying the pathways toward collective properties and self-assembled materials, beyond the range of phenomena accessible with ordinary molecular fluids.},

abstract = {The force distribution of jammed disordered packings has always been considered a central object in the physics of granular materials. However, many of its features are poorly understood. In particular, analytic relations to other key macroscopic properties of jammed matter, such as the contact network and its coordination number, are still lacking. Here we develop a mean-field approach to this problem, based on the consideration of the contact network as a random graph where the force transmission becomes a constraint optimization problem. We can thus use the cavity method developed in the last decades within the statistical physics of spin glasses and hard computer science problems. This method allows us to compute the force distribution \$\backslash text P(f)\$ for random packings of hard particles of any shape, with or without friction.   We find a new signature of jamming in the small force behavior   \$\backslash text P(f) \backslash sim f\^{}\{\backslash theta\}\$, whose exponent has attracted recent active interest. We find a finite value for \$\backslash text P(f=0)\$, along with \$\backslash theta=0\$ over an unprecedented six decades of force data, which agrees with experimental measurements on emulsion droplets.   Furthermore, we relate the force distribution to a lower bound of the average coordination number \$\{\backslash bar z\}\_\{\backslash rm c\}\^{}\{\backslash rm min\}(\backslash mu)\$ of jammed packings of frictional spheres with coefficient \$\backslash mu\$. This bridges the gap between the two known isostatic limits \$\{\backslash bar z\}\_c(\backslash mu=0)=2D\$ (in dimension \$D\$) and \$\{\backslash bar z\}\_c(\backslash mu \backslash to \backslash infty)=D+1\$ by extending the naive Maxwell's counting argument to frictional spheres.   The framework describes different types of systems, such as non-spherical objects and dimensions, providing a common mean-field scenario to investigate force transmission, contact networks and coordination numbers of jammed disordered packings.},

abstract = {A liquid droplet resting on a soft gel substrate can deform that substrate to the point of material failure, whereby fractures develop on the gel surface that propagate outwards from the contact-line in a starburst pattern. In this paper, we characterize i) the initiation process in which the number of arms in the starburst is controlled by the ratio of surface tension contrast to the gel's elastic modulus and ii) the propagation dynamics showing that once fractures are initiated they propagate with a universal power law \$L\backslash propto t\^{}\{3/4\}\$. We develop a model for crack initiation by treating the gel as a linear elastic solid and computing the deformations within the substrate from the liquid/solid wetting forces. The elastic solution shows that both the location and magnitude of the wetting forces are critical in providing a quantitative prediction for the number of fractures and, hence, an interpretation of the initiation of capillary fractures. This solution also reveals that the depth of the gel is an important factor in the fracture process, as it can help mitigate large surface tractions; this finding is confirmed with experiments. We then develop a model for crack propagation by considering the transport of an inviscid fluid into the fracture tip of an incompressible material, and find that a simple energy-conservation argument can explain the observed material-independent power law. We compare predictions for both linear elastic and neo-Hookean solids finding that the latter better explains the observed exponent.},

However, a prebiotic conversion of these weakly activated monomers, and their purine counterparts, to the 3',5'-linked RNA polymers of extant biochemistry has been lacking (previous attempts led only to short oligomers with mixed linkages). Here we show that the 2'-hydroxyl group of oligoribonucleotide-3'-phosphates can be chemoselectively acetylated in water under prebiotically credible conditions, which allows rapid and efficient template-directed ligation. The 2'-O-acetyl group at the ligation junction of the product RNA strand can be removed under conditions that leave the internucleotide bonds intact. Remarkably, acetylation of mixed oligomers that possess either 2'- or 3'-terminal phosphates is selective for the 2'-hydroxyl group of the latter. This newly discovered chemistry thus suggests a prebiotic route from ribonucleoside-2',3'-cyclic phosphates to predominantly 3',5'-linked RNA via partially 2'-O-acetylated RNA.},

Evolution provides a large part of the answer, but this requires molecules that can carry information (that is, exist in many variants) and can replicate themselves. The process is commonplace in living organisms, but not so easy to achieve with simple chemical systems. It is especially difficult to contemplate in the chemical chaos of the prebiotic world. Although popular in many quarters, the notion that RNA was the first self-replicator carries many difficulties. Here, we present an alternative view, suggesting that there may be undiscovered self-replication mechanisms possible in much simpler systems. In particular, we highlight the possibility of information coding through stereochemical configurations of substituents in organic polymers. We also show that this coding system leads naturally to enantiopurity, solving the apparent problem of biological homochirality.},

We use these data, as well as measured reaction rates, to argue against propulsion by either neutral or ionic self-diffusiophoresis. However, our data are consistent with propulsion by a self-generated surface ionic current, which can derive from general asymmetries of the particle.

Hybrid high-performance computers, machines with more than one type of floating-point processor, are now becoming more prevalent due to these advantages. In this work, we discuss several important issues in porting a large molecular dynamics code for use on parallel hybrid machines (1) choosing a hybrid parallel decomposition that works on central processing units (CPUs) with distributed memory and accelerator cores with shared memory, (2) minimizing the amount of code that must be ported for efficient acceleration, (3) utilizing the available processing power from both multi-core CPUs and accelerators, and (4) choosing a programming model for acceleration. We present our solution to each of these issues for short-range force calculation in the molecular dynamics package LAMMPS, however, the methods can be applied in many molecular dynamics codes. Specifically, we describe algorithms for efficient short range force calculation on hybrid high-performance machines. We describe an approach for dynamic load balancing of work between CPU and accelerator cores. We describe the Geryon library that allows a single code to compile with both CUDA and OpenCL for use on a variety of accelerators.

While intuitively chiral particles can self-assemble into chiral superstructures, it is often less obvious how achiral particles can do the same. Here we show that there is a potentially general, packing-based mechanism that explains why many simple, two-dimensional achiral particles assemble into chiral materials. Namely, we use simulations of hard, regular polygons to show that the subtle shape modification of corner rounding surprisingly can induce chiral symmetry breaking by deforming the underlying close-packed lattice. The mechanism quantitatively explains recent experimental results reporting chiral symmetry breaking in the hard triangle system. Moreover, it predicts similar symmetry breaking in the rounded hard rectangle system, which we verify through simulations. Because effective corner rounding is easily realized by modulating repulsive interactions in real systems, this simple mechanism suggests tremendous potential for creating dynamically tunable chiral surfaces with a variety of applications.},

The fraction of protein surface in crystal contacts is very variable and independent of the number of packing contacts. The thermal motion at the crystal packing interface and that of the protein core, even for large packing interfaces, though the tendency is to be closer to that of the core.

abstract = {Polymeric micro- and nanoparticles play a central role in varied applications such as drug delivery, medical imaging, and advanced materials, as well as in fundamental studies in fields such as microfluidics and nanotechnology. Functional behavior of polymeric particles in these fields is strongly influenced by their shape. However, the availability of precisely shaped polymeric particles has been a major bottleneck in understanding and capitalizing on the role of shape in particle function. Here we report a method that directly addresses this need. Our method uses routine laboratory chemicals and equipment to make particles with >20 distinct shapes and characteristic features ranging in size from 60 nm to 30 microm. This method offers independent control over important particle properties such as size and shape, which is crucial to the development of nonspherical particles both as tools and products for a variety of fields.},

abstract = {Dislocations and their interactions strongly influence many material properties, ranging from the strength of metals and alloys to the efficiency of light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. Several experimental methods can be used to visualize dislocations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has long been used to image dislocations in materials, and high-resolution electron microscopy can reveal dislocation core structures in high detail, particularly in annular dark-field mode. A TEM image, however, represents a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional (3D) object (although stereo TEM provides limited information about 3D dislocations). X-ray topography can image dislocations in three dimensions, but with reduced resolution. Using weak-beam dark-field TEM and scanning TEM, electron tomography has been used to image 3D dislocations at a resolution of about five nanometres (refs 15, 16). Atom probe tomography can offer higher-resolution 3D characterization of dislocations, but requires needle-shaped samples and can detect only about 60 per cent of the atoms in a sample. Here we report 3D imaging of dislocations in materials at atomic resolution by electron tomography. By applying 3D Fourier filtering together with equal-slope tomographic reconstruction, we observe nearly all the atoms in a multiply twinned platinum nanoparticle. We observed atomic steps at 3D twin boundaries and imaged the 3D core structure of edge and screw dislocations at atomic resolution. These dislocations and the atomic steps at the twin boundaries, which appear to be stress-relief mechanisms, are not visible in conventional two-dimensional projections. The ability to image 3D disordered structures such as dislocations at atomic resolution is expected to find applications in materials science, nanoscience, solid-state physics and chemistry.},

Shape control of a colloidal nanocrystal is believed to be a kinetic process, with high-energy facets growing faster then vanishing, leading to nanocrystals enclosed by low-energy facets. Identifying a surfactant that can specifically bind to a particular crystal facet is critical, but has proved challenging to date. Biomolecules have exquisite specific molecular recognition properties that can be explored for the precise engineering of nanostructured materials. Here, we report the use of facet-specific peptide sequences as regulating agents for the predictable synthesis of platinum nanocrystals with selectively exposed crystal surfaces and particular shapes. The formation of platinum nanocubes and nanotetrahedrons are demonstrated with Pt-\{100\} and Pt-\{111\} binding peptides, respectively. Our studies unambiguously demonstrate the abilities of facet-selective binding peptides in determining nanocrystal shape, representing a critical step forward in the use of biomolecules for programmable synthesis of nanostructures.},

abstract = {Contraction of blood clots is necessary for hemostasis, wound healing and to restore flow past obstructive thrombi, but little has been known about the structure of contracted clots or the role of erythrocytes in contraction. We found that contracted blood clots develop a remarkable structure, with a meshwork of fibrin and platelet aggregates on the exterior of the clot and a close-packed, tessellated array of compressed polyhedral erythrocytes within. The same results were obtained after initiation of clotting with various activators and also with clots from reconstituted human blood and mouse blood. Such close-packed arrays of polyhedral erythrocytes, or polyhedrocytes, were also observed in human arterial thrombi taken from patients. The mechanical nature of this shape change was confirmed by polyhedrocyte formation from the forces of centrifugation of blood without clotting. Platelets (with their cytoskeletal motility proteins) and fibrin(ogen) (as the substrate bridging platelets for contraction) are required to generate the forces necessary to segregate platelets/fibrin from erythrocytes and to compress erythrocytes into a tightly packed array. These results demonstrate how contracted clots form an impermeable barrier important for hemostasis and wound healing and help explain how fibrinolysis is greatly retarded as clots contract.},

Particular emphasis is put on the numerical long-time stability in terms of energy and momentum conservation, and caveats on limited floating-point precision are issued. Strict energy conservation over 10 8 MD steps is obtained by double-single emulation of the floating-point arithmetic in accuracy-critical parts of the algorithm. For the slow dynamics of a supercooled binary Lennard-Jones mixture, we demonstrate that the use of single-floating point precision may result in quantitatively and even physically wrong results. For simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid, the described implementation shows speedup factors of up to 80 compared to a serial implementation for the CPU, and a single GPU was found to compare with a parallelised MD simulation using 64 distributed cores.},

abstract = {Bacteria communicate via short-range physical and chemical signals, interactions known to mediate quorum sensing, sporulation, and other adaptive phenotypes. Although most in vitro studies examine bacterial properties averaged over large populations, the levels of key molecular determinants of bacterial fitness and pathogenicity (e.g., oxygen, quorum-sensing signals) may vary over micrometer scales within small, dense cellular aggregates believed to play key roles in disease transmission. A detailed understanding of how cell-cell interactions contribute to pathogenicity in natural, complex environments will require a new level of control in constructing more relevant cellular models for assessing bacterial phenotypes. Here, we describe a microscopic three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy that enables multiple populations of bacteria to be organized within essentially any 3D geometry, including adjacent, nested, and free-floating colonies. In this laser-based lithographic technique, microscopic containers are formed around selected bacteria suspended in gelatin via focal cross-linking of polypeptide molecules. After excess reagent is removed, trapped bacteria are localized within sealed cavities formed by the cross-linked gelatin, a highly porous material that supports rapid growth of fully enclosed cellular populations and readily transmits numerous biologically active species, including polypeptides, antibiotics, and quorum-sensing signals. Using this approach, we show that a picoliter-volume aggregate of Staphylococcus aureus can display substantial resistance to \{beta\}-lactam antibiotics by enclosure within a shell composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.},

Each cluster measures about 2.5 nm across and consists of nineteen concentrically condensed hexagonal antiprismatic Ta(13) clusters which are capped with Te atoms. The Ta(151)Te(74) clusters can cover the plane distinctly in different ways, thereby forming a series of phases which are closely related both structurally and compositionally. In Ta(97)Te(60) the buckled clusters decorate the vertices of a square tiling at a 2 nm length scale to result in corrugated (infinity)(2)[Te(30)Ta(41)Ta(15)Ta(41)Te(30)] each about 1 nm thick. The lamellae are stacked along the c axis, corresponding to the direction of the pseudo-twelvefold axis of symmetry. Symmetry arguments are proposed that the twinning of the structure may be associated with a fine-tuning of weak interlayer Te-Te interactions which are reflected in a minimization of the deviation from the mean distance <d(Te-Te)> and a doubling of the stacking vector c.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles assemble at the interface between two fluids into disordered, liquid-like arrays where the nanoparticles can diffuse laterally at the interface. Using nanoparticles dispersed in water and amine end-capped polymers in oil, nanoparticle surfactants are generated in situ at the interface overcoming the inherent weak forces governing the interfacial adsorption of nanoparticles. When the shape of the liquid domain is deformed by an external field, the surface area increases and more nanoparticles adsorb to the interface. Upon releasing the field, the interfacial area decreases, jamming the nanoparticle surfactants and arresting further shape change. The jammed nanoparticles remain disordered and liquid-like, enabling multiple, consecutive deformation and jamming events. Further stabilization is realized by replacing monofunctional ligands with difunctional versions that cross-link the assemblies. The ability to generate and stabilize liquids with a prescribed shape poses opportunities for reactive liquid systems, packaging, delivery, and storage.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles (NP) functionalized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) offer a route to custom-designed, self-assembled nanomaterials with potentially unusual properties. The bonding selectivity of DNA guarantees one-to-one binding to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and an appropriate base sequence results in head-to-tail binding linking NP into networks. We explore the phase behavior and structure of a model for NP functionalized with between 3 and 6 short ssDNA through simulations of a coarse-grained molecular model, allowing us to examine both the role of the number of attached strands (valency) and their relative orientations. The NP assemble into networks where the number of NP links is controlled by the number of attached strands. The large length scale of the DNA links relative to the core NP size opens the possibility for the formation of interpenetrating networks that give rise to multiple thermodynamically distinct states. We find that the 3-functionalized NP have only a single phase transition between a dilute solution of NPs and an assembled network state. 4-Functionalized NP (with tetrahedral symmetry) exhibit four amorphous phases, or polyamorphism, each higher density phase consisting of an additional interpenetrating network. The two investigated geometries of 5-functionalized NP both exhibit two phase transitions and three amorphous phases. Like the 4-functionalized NP, the highest density phase consists of interpenetrating networks, demonstrating that regular symmetry is not a prerequisite for interpenetration to produce thermodynamically distinct phases. The width of the coexistence regions for all phase transitions increases with increasing functionality. Finally, for 6-functionalized NP with octahedral symmetry, the possibility of observing disordered phases with significantly bonded particles is preempted by the formation of ordered crystal phases. Interestingly, the extreme softness of the potential combined with the directional interaction allows for the formation of (at least) six distinct crystalline structures (i.e., polymorphism) consisting of up to six interpenetrating simple cubic lattices.},

abstract = {Polyhedra and their arrangements have intrigued humankind since the ancient Greeks and are today important motifs in condensed matter, with application to many classes of liquids and solids. Yet, little is known about the thermodynamically stable phases of polyhedrally-shaped building blocks, such as faceted nanoparticles and colloids. Although hard particles are known to organize due to entropy alone, and some unusual phases are reported in the literature, the role of entropic forces in connection with polyhedral shape is not well understood. Here, we study thermodynamic self-assembly of a family of truncated tetrahedra and report several atomic crystal isostructures, including diamond, \{$\backslash$beta\}-tin, and high- pressure lithium, as the polyhedron shape varies from tetrahedral to octahedral. We compare our findings with the densest packings of the truncated tetrahedron family obtained by numerical compression and report a new space filling polyhedron, which has been overlooked in previous searches. Interestingly, the self-assembled structures differ from the densest packings. We show that the self-assembled crystal structures can be understood as a tendency for polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment, which can be generalized as directional entropic forces.},

abstract = {Quasicrystals are long-range-ordered materials that lack translational invariance, so the study of their physical properties remains a challenging problem. Here, we have carried out inelastic-X-ray- and neutron-scattering experiments on single-grain samples of the Zn-Mg-Sc icosahedral quasicrystal and of the Zn-Sc periodic cubic 1/1 approximant, with the aim of studying the respective influence of the local order and of the long-range order (periodic or quasiperiodic) on lattice dynamics. Besides the overall similarities and the existence of a pseudo-gap in the transverse dispersion relation, marked differences are observed, the pseudo-gap being larger and better defined in the approximant than in the quasicrystal. This can be qualitatively explained using the concept of a pseudo-Brillouin-zone in the quasicrystal. These results are compared with simulations on atomic models and using oscillating pair potentials, and the simulations reproduce in detail the experimental results. This paves the way for a detailed understanding of the physics of quasicrystals.},

abstract = {We have investigated the effect of particle shape in Pickering emulsions by employing, for the first time, cubic and peanut-shaped particles. The interfacial packing and orientation of anisotropic microparticles are revealed at the single particle level by direct microscopic observations. The uniform anisotropic hematite microparticles adsorb irreversibly at the oil-water interface in monolayers and form solid-stabilized o/w emulsions via the process of limited coalescence. Emulsions were stable against further coalescence for at least one year. We found that cubes assembled at the interface in monolayers with a packing intermediate between hexagonal and cubic and average packing densities up to 90\%. Local domains displayed densities even higher than theoretically achievable for spheres. Cubes exclusively orient parallel with one of their flat sides at the oil-water interface, while peanuts preferentially attach parallel with their long side. Those peanut-shaped microparticles assemble in locally ordered, interfacial particle stacks that may interlock. Indications for long-range capillary interactions were not found and we hypothesize that this is related to the observed stable orientations of cubes and peanuts which marginalize deformations of the interface.},

Both planar and homeotropic anchoring of the nematic director can be induced at the walls through a free-energy penalty. The circular geometry creates frustration in the nematic phase and a polar-symmetry configuration with a distorted director field plus two \$+1/2\$ disclinations is created. At higher densities, a quasi-uniform structure is observed with a (minimal) director distortion which is relaxed via the formation of orientational domain walls. This novel structure is not predicted by elasticity theory and is similar to the step-like structures observed in three-dimensional hybrid slit pores. We speculate that the formation of domain walls is a general mechanism to relax elastic stresses in conditions of strong surface anchoring and severe spatial confinement.},

The semiconservative replication that is characteristic of genetic information transfer requires strands that contain more than one type of nucleobase. Short strands of RNA can act as catalysts, but attempts to induce efficient self-copying of mixed sequences (containing four different nucleobases) have been unsuccessful with ribonucleotides. Here we show that inhibition by spent monomers, formed by the hydrolysis of the activated nucleotides, is the cause for incomplete extension of growing daughter strands on RNA templates. Immobilization of strands and periodic displacement of the solution containing the activated monomers overcome this inhibition. Any of the four nucleobases (A/C/G/U) is successfully copied in the absence of enzymes. We conclude therefore that in a prebiotic world, oligoribonucleotides may have formed and undergone self-copying on surfaces.},

abstract = {Surfaces decorated with dense arrays of microscopic fibres exhibit unique materials properties, including superhydrophobicity and low friction. Nature relies on 'hairy' surfaces to protect blood capillaries from wear and infection (endothelial glycocalyx). Here we report on the discovery of self-assembled tunable networks of microscopic polymer fibres ranging from wavy colloidal 'fur' to highly interconnected networks. The networks emerge via dynamic self-assembly in an alternating electric field from a non-aqueous suspension of 'sticky' polymeric colloidal particles with a controlled degree of polymerization. The resulting architectures are tuned by the frequency and amplitude of the electric field and surface properties of the particles. We demonstrate, using atomic layer deposition, that the networks can serve as a template for a transparent conductor. These self-assembled tunable materials are promising candidates for large surface area electrodes in batteries and organic photovoltaic cells, as well as for microfluidic sensors and filters.},

abstract = {Precisely shaped polymeric particles and structures are widely used for applications in photonic materials, MEMS, biomaterials and self-assembly. Current approaches for particle synthesis are either batch processes or flow-through microfluidic schemes that are based on two-phase systems, limiting the throughput, shape and functionality of the particles. We report a one-phase method that combines the advantages of microscope projection photolithography and microfluidics to continuously form morphologically complex or multifunctional particles down to the colloidal length scale. Exploiting the inhibition of free-radical polymerization near PDMS surfaces, we are able to repeatedly pattern and flow rows of particles in less than 0.1 s, affording a throughput of near 100 particles per second using the simplest of device designs. Polymerization was also carried out across laminar, co-flowing streams to generate Janus particles containing different chemistries, whose relative proportions could be easily tuned. This new high-throughput technique offers unprecedented control over particle size, shape and anisotropy.},

abstract = {Spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanostructures assemble into a large variety of well-defined crystalline superlattices via DNA-directed hybridization. Crystallities of SNA with various shapes emerge during the assembly process, which coalesce during coarsening, leading to polycrystalline materials. Here, we investigate the growth dynamics of SNAs into body-centered cubic superlattices and the coalescence of SNA aggregates using a colloidal model formulated from the competition of electrostatic core repulsions and localized DNA hybridization attractions. We find that the growth law of isolated SNA crystallities is well-described by the power law t(1/2), in agreement with experimental observations. At later times, coalescence slows the growth dynamics considerably and is dependent on the orientational mismatch (misorientation angle) of the coalescing crystallites. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the misorientation angle decreases continually during the coalescence, which is a signature of the grain rotation induced coalescence mechanism. This mechanism is followed by the coarsening of a "neck" that develops at the boundary between the coalescing crystallites. Remarkably, we find faster coalescence dynamics for larger SNAs compared to smaller SNAs due to their enhanced surface diffusion, which more effectively reduces curvature at the boundary of two superlattices. These findings provide fundamental insight into the relationship between nanoparticle surface chemistry and its crystallite growth and coalescence.},

These layered hybrids emit radiation across the entire visible spectrum upon ultra-violet excitation. They are promising as single-source white-light phosphors for use with ultraviolet light-emitting diodes in solid-state lighting devices. The broadband emission provides high color rendition and the chromaticity coordinates of the emission can be tuned through halide substitution. We have isolated materials that emit the 'warm' white light sought for many indoor lighting applications as well as 'cold' white light that approximates the visible region of the solar spectrum. Material syntheses are inexpensive and scalable and binding agents are not required for film deposition, eliminating problems of binder photodegradation. These well-defined and tunable structures provide a flexible platform for studying the rare phenomenon of intrinsic broadband emission from bulk materials.},

abstract = {Complex nematic fluids have the remarkable capability for self-assembling regular colloidal structures of various symmetries and dimensionality according to their micromolecular orientational order. Colloidal chains, clusters, and crystals were demonstrated recently, exhibiting soft-matter functionalities of robust binding, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, entanglement, shape-driven and topological driven assembly, and even memory imprinting. However, no quasicrystalline structures were found. Here, we show with numerical modeling that quasicrystalline colloidal lattices can be achieved in the form of original Penrose P1 tiling by using pentagonal colloidal platelets in layers of nematic liquid crystals. The tilings are energetically stabilized with binding energies up to 2500 kBT for micrometer-sized platelets and further allow for hierarchical substitution tiling, i.e., hierarchical pentagulation. Quasicrystalline structures are constructed bottom-up by assembling the boat, rhombus, and star maximum density clusters, thus avoiding other (nonquasicrystalline) stable or metastable configurations of platelets. Central to our design of the quasicrystalline tilings is the symmetry breaking imposed by the platelet shape and the surface anchoring conditions at the colloidal platelets, which are misaligning and asymmetric over two perpendicular mirror planes. Finally, the design of the quasicrystalline tilings as platelets in nematic liquid crystals is inherently capable of a continuous variety of length scales of the tiling, ranging over three orders of magnitude in the typical length (from ∼10 nm to ∼10 $\mu$m), which could allow for the design of quasicrystalline photonics at multiple frequency ranges.},

abstract = {Cells in a developing embryo have no direct way of "measuring" their physical position. Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of [\~{}]1\% along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

abstract = {Interactions between the components in many-body systems can give rise to spontaneous formation of complex structures. Usually very little is known about the connection between the interactions and the resulting structure. Here we present a theory for self-assembling pattern formation in multi-component systems, formulated as an analytic technique that predicts morphologies directly from the interactions in an effective model. As a demonstration we apply the method to a model of alkanethiols on spherical gold particles, successfully predicting its morphologies and transitions as a function of the interaction parameters. This system is interesting because it has been suggested to provide an effective route to produce patchy colloids.},

The second scenario has so far always been observed in a metastable liquid domain below the melting point where crystalline nucleation interfered with the glass formation. We report the first observation of the liquid-glass transition by a first-order polyamorphous phase transition from the equilibrium stable liquid phase. The observation was made in a molecular dynamics simulation of a one-component system with a model metallic pair potential. In this way, the model, demonstrating the thermodynamic glass transition from a stable liquid phase, may be regarded as a candidate for a simple monatomic ideal glass former. This observation is of conceptual importance in the context of continuing attempts to resolve the long-standing Kauzmann paradox. The possibility of a thermodynamic glass transition from an equilibrium melt in a metallic system also indicates a new strategy for the development of bulk metallic glass-forming alloys.},

abstract = {While performing molecular dynamics simulations of a simple monatomic liquid, we observed the crystallization of a material displaying octagonal symmetry in its simulated diffraction pattern. Inspection of the atomic arrangements in the crystallization product reveals large grains of the beta-Mn structure aligned along a common 4-fold axis, with 45 degree rotations between neighboring grains. These 45 degree rotations can be traced to the intercession of a second crystalline structure fused epitaxially to the beta-Mn domain surfaces, whose primitive cell has lattice parameters a = b = c = abeta-Mn, alpha = beta = 90 degrees, and gamma = 45 degrees. This secondary phase adopts a structure which appears to have no known counterpart in the experimental literature, but can be simply derived from the Cr3Si and Al3Zr4 structure types. We used these observations as the basis for an atomistic structural model for octagonal quasicrystals, in which the beta-Mn and the secondary phase structure unit cells serve as square and rhombic tiles (in projection), respectively. Its diffraction pattern down the octagonal axis resembles those experimentally measured. The model is unique in being consistent with high-resolution electron microscopy images showing square and rhombic units with edge-lengths equal to that of the beta-Mn unit cell. Energy minimization of this configuration, using the same pair potential as above, results in an alternative octagonal quasiperiodic structure with the same tiling but a different atomic decoration and diffraction pattern.},

abstract = {Since the structure of DNA was elucidated more than 50 years ago, Watson-Crick base pairing has been widely speculated to be the likely mode of both information storage and transfer in the earliest genetic polymers. The discovery of catalytic RNA molecules subsequently provided support for the hypothesis that RNA was perhaps even the first polymer of life. However, the de novo synthesis of RNA using only plausible prebiotic chemistry has proven difficult, to say the least. Experimental investigations, made possible by the application of synthetic and physical organic chemistry, have now provided evidence that the nucleobases (A, G, C, and T/U), the trifunctional moiety ([deoxy]ribose), and the linkage chemistry (phosphate esters) of contemporary nucleic acids may be optimally suited for their present roles-a situation that suggests refinement by evolution. Here, we consider studies of variations in these three distinct components of nucleic acids with regard to the question: Is RNA, as is generally acknowledged of DNA, the product of evolution? If so, what chemical and structural features might have been more likely and advantageous for a proto-RNA?},

abstract = {A plausible process for non-enzymatic RNA replication would greatly simplify models of the transition from prebiotic chemistry to simple biology. However, all known conditions for the chemical copying of an RNA template result in the synthesis of a complementary strand that contains a mixture of 2'-5' and 3'-5' linkages, rather than the selective synthesis of only 3'-5' linkages as found in contemporary RNA. Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise be too stable for thermal strand separation. By allowing copied strands to dissociate, this heterogeneity may have been one of the essential features that allowed RNA to emerge as the first biopolymer.},

We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.},

abstract = {We investigate methodological issues concerning the direct coexistence method, an increasingly popular approach to evaluate the solid-fluid coexistence by means of computer simulations. The first issue is the impact of the simulation ensemble on the results. We compare the NpT ensemble (easy to use but approximate) with the NpzT ensemble (rigorous but more difficult to handle). Our work shows that both ensembles yield similar results for large systems (>5000 particles). Another issue, which is usually disregarded, is the stochastic character of a direct coexistence simulation. Here, we assess the impact of stochasticity in the determination of the coexistence point. We demonstrate that the error generated by stochasticity is much larger than that caused by the use of the NpT ensemble, and can be minimized by simply increasing the system size. To perform this study we use the pseudo hard-sphere model recently proposed by Jover et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 137, 144505 (2012)], and obtain a coexistence pressure of p∗ = 11.65(1), quite similar to that of hard spheres (only about 0.6\% higher). Therefore, we conclude that this model can be reliably used to investigate the physics of hard spheres in phenomena like crystal nucleation.},

abstract = {We report a parallel Monte Carlo algorithm accelerated by graphics processing units (GPU) for modeling time-resolved photon migration in arbitrary 3D turbid media. By taking advantage of the massively parallel threads and low-memory latency, this algorithm allows many photons to be simulated simultaneously in a GPU. To further improve the computational efficiency, we explored two parallel random number generators (RNG), including a floating-point-only RNG based on a chaotic lattice. An efficient scheme for boundary reflection was implemented, along with the functions for time-resolved imaging. For a homogeneous semi-infinite medium, good agreement was observed between the simulation output and the analytical solution from the diffusion theory. The code was implemented with CUDA programming language, and benchmarked under various parameters, such as thread number, selection of RNG and memory access pattern. With a low-cost graphics card, this algorithm has demonstrated an acceleration ratio above 300 when using 1792 parallel threads over conventional CPU computation. The acceleration ratio drops to 75 when using atomic operations. These results render the GPU-based Monte Carlo simulation a practical solution for data analysis in a wide range of diffuse optical imaging applications, such as human brain or small-animal imaging.},

In particular, sheared ellipses demonstrate exceptionally slow dynamical evolution that does not have a counterpart for disks. This slow dynamics appears in the mean velocity, local density, orientational order, and local stress. Starting from an unjammed state, ellipses first jam under shear, and then unjam due to small slow changes in their orientations. For jammed states, avalanche behavior, namely the building up and relaxation of stresses, is qualitatively different for disks and ellipses and leads to strikingly different stress rate dependence for ellipses vs. disks. Unlike the weak rate dependence typical of many granular systems, ellipses show power-law dependence on the shearing rate, \{$\backslash$Omega\}.},

abstract = {The modern ribosome was largely formed at the time of the last common ancestor, LUCA. Hence its earliest origins likely lie in the RNA world. Central to its development were RNAs that spawned the modern tRNAs and a symmetrical region deep within the large ribosomal RNA, (rRNA), where the peptidyl transferase reaction occurs. To understand pre-LUCA developments, it is argued that events that are coupled in time are especially useful if one can infer a likely order in which they occurred. Using such timing events, the relative age of various proteins and individual regions within the large rRNA are inferred. An examination of the properties of modern ribosomes strongly suggests that the initial peptides made by the primitive ribosomes were likely enriched for l-amino acids, but did not completely exclude d-amino acids. This has implications for the nature of peptides made by the first ribosomes. From the perspective of ribosome origins, the immediate question regarding coding is when did it arise rather than how did the assignments evolve. The modern ribosome is very dynamic with tRNAs moving in and out and the mRNA moving relative to the ribosome. These movements may have become possible as a result of the addition of a template to hold the tRNAs. That template would subsequently become the mRNA, thereby allowing the evolution of the code and making an RNA genome useful. Finally, a highly speculative timeline of major events in ribosome history is presented and possible future directions discussed.},

Remarkably, such CuI tetrahedron is found to possess high removal capacity for poisonous Cd(II) ions, 136.3mg/g, and ideal reusability. This is ascribed to the hierarchical micro/nano-structure and chemical adsorption mechanism, which shows great advantages over the traditional nano-scaled adsorbents. These interesting results stand out the promising applications of such hierarchically micro/nano-structured materials in environment.

This article describes features of the Tree of Life, such as how the tree has been both pruned and become bushier throughout the past century as our knowledge of biology has expanded. We present current views that the classification of life may be best illustrated as a ring or even a coral with tree-like characteristics. This article also discusses how the organization of the Tree of Life offers clues about ancient life on Earth. In particular, we focus on the environmental conditions and temperature history of Precambrian life and show how chemical, biological, and geological data can converge to better understand this history."You know, a tree is a tree.

This packing pattern persists even at densities where particle overlap becomes sizable. We demonstrate that the antinematic arrangement is compatible with the A15 crystal lattice reported in several dendrimer compounds.},

abstract = {In colloidal crystals of spheres, dislocation motion is unrestricted. On the other hand, recent studies of relaxation in crystals of colloidal dimer particles have demonstrated that the dislocation dynamics in such crystals are reminiscent of glassy systems. The observed glassy dynamics arise as a result of dislocation cages formed by certain dimer orientations. In the current study, we use experiments and simulations to investigate the transition that arises when a pure sphere crystal is doped with an increasing concentration of dimers. Specifically, we focus on both dislocation caging and vacancy motion. Interestingly, we find that any nonzero fraction of dimers introduces finite dislocation cages, suggesting that glassy dynamics are present for any mixed crystal. However, we have also identified a vacancy-mediated uncaging mechanism for releasing dislocations from their cages. This mechanism is dependent on vacancy diffusion, which slows by orders of magnitude as the dimer concentration is increased. We propose that in mixed crystals with low dimer concentrations vacancy diffusion is fast enough to uncage dislocations and delay the onset of glassy dislocation dynamics.},

In contrast, we find that impact-induced shock compression of cometary ices followed by expansion to ambient conditions can produce complexes that resemble the amino acid glycine. Our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that shock waves drive the synthesis of transient C-N bonded oligomers at extreme pressures and temperatures. On post impact quenching to lower pressures, the oligomers break apart to form a metastable glycine-containing complex. We show that impact from cometary ice could possibly yield amino acids by a synthetic route independent of the pre-existing atmospheric conditions and materials on the planet.},

abstract = {We present an implementation of generalized Born implicit solvent all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely on CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.},

abstract = {Connections between microscopic dynamical observables and macroscopic nonequilibrium (NE) properties have been pursued in statistical physics since Boltzmann, Gibbs, and Maxwell. The simulations we describe here establish a relationship between the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and the energy dissipated as heat from a NE system to its environment. First, we show that the Kolmogorov-Sinai or dynamical entropy can be separated into system and bath components and that the entropy of the system \$\$\{h\}\_\{sys\}\$\$ characterizes the dynamics of energy dissipation. Second, we find that the average change in the system dynamical entropy is linearly related to the average change in the energy dissipated to the bath. The constant energy and time scales of the bath fix the dynamical relationship between these two quantities. These results provide a link between microscopic dynamical variables and the macroscopic energetics of NE processes.},

abstract = {Advancements in the synthesis of faceted nanoparticles and colloids have spurred interest in the phase behavior of polyhedral shapes. Regular tetrahedra have attracted particular attention because they prefer local symmetries that are incompatible with periodicity. Two dense phases of regular tetrahedra have been reported recently. The densest known tetrahedron packing is achieved in a crystal of triangular bipyramids (dimers) with a packing density of 4000/4671 ≈ 85.63\%. In simulation a dodecagonal quasicrystal is observed; its approximant, with periodic tiling (3.4.3(2).4), can be compressed to a packing fraction of 85.03\%. Here, we show that the quasicrystal approximant is more stable than the dimer crystal for packing densities below 84\% using Monte Carlo computer simulations and free energy calculations. To carry out the free energy calculations, we use a variation of the Frenkel-Ladd method for anisotropic shapes and thermodynamic integration. The enhanced stability of the approximant can be attributed to a network substructure, which maximizes the free volume (and hence the wiggle room) available to the particles and facilitates correlated motion of particles, which further contributes to entropy and leads to diffusion for packing densities below 65\%. The existence of a solid-solid transition between structurally distinct phases not related by symmetry breaking--the approximant and the dimer crystal--is unusual for hard particle systems.},

abstract = {All hard, convex shapes are conjectured by Ulam to pack more densely than spheres, which have a maximum packing fraction of phi = pi/ radical18 approximately 0.7405. Simple lattice packings of many shapes easily surpass this packing fraction. For regular tetrahedra, this conjecture was shown to be true only very recently; an ordered arrangement was obtained via geometric construction with phi = 0.7786 (ref. 4), which was subsequently compressed numerically to phi = 0.7820 (ref. 5), while compressing with different initial conditions led to phi = 0.8230 (ref. 6). Here we show that tetrahedra pack even more densely, and in a completely unexpected way. Following a conceptually different approach, using thermodynamic computer simulations that allow the system to evolve naturally towards high-density states, we observe that a fluid of hard tetrahedra undergoes a first-order phase transition to a dodecagonal quasicrystal, which can be compressed to a packing fraction of phi = 0.8324. By compressing a crystalline approximant of the quasicrystal, the highest packing fraction we obtain is phi = 0.8503. If quasicrystal formation is suppressed, the system remains disordered, jams and compresses to phi = 0.7858. Jamming and crystallization are both preceded by an entropy-driven transition from a simple fluid of independent tetrahedra to a complex fluid characterized by tetrahedra arranged in densely packed local motifs of pentagonal dipyramids that form a percolating network at the transition. The quasicrystal that we report represents the first example of a quasicrystal formed from hard or non-spherical particles. Our results demonstrate that particle shape and entropy can produce highly complex, ordered structures.},

In this paper, we investigate the random packing structure of two-dimensional (2D) snowmen via wax-snowman packing experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations. Both experiments and simulations reveal that neighboring snowmen have a strong short-range orientational correlation and consequently locally form particular conformations. A chiral conformation is dominant for high area fractions near the jamming condition ($\phi$>0.8), and the proportion of the chiral conformation increases with $\gamma$. We also found that the attractive interaction does not have a significant impact on the results. The geometry of chirally ordered snowmen causes a mismatch with 2D crystalline symmetries and thus inhibits the development of long-range spatial order, despite the strong orientational correlation between neighbors.},

abstract = {Lithium is considered a 'simple' metal because, under ordinary conditions of pressure and temperature, the motion of conduction electrons is only weakly perturbed by interactions with the cubic lattice of atomic cores. It was recently predicted that at pressures below 100 GPa, dense Li may undergo several structural transitions, possibly leading to a 'paired-atom' phase with low symmetry and near-insulating properties. Here we report synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements that confirm that Li undergoes pronounced structural changes under pressure. Near 39 GPa, the element transforms from a high-pressure face-centred-cubic phase, through an intermediate rhombohedral modification, to a cubic polymorph with 16 atoms per unit cell. This cubic phase has not been observed previously in any element; unusually, its calculated electronic density of states exhibits a pronounced semimetal-like minimum near the Fermi energy. We present total-energy calculations that provide theoretical support for the observed phase transition sequence. Our calculations indicate a large stability range of the 16-atom cubic phase relative to various other crystal structures tested here.},

Fine-grained clay minerals and hydroxides facilitate lipid self-organization and condensation polymerization reactions, notably of RNA monomers. Surfaces of common rock-forming oxides, silicates, and carbonates select and concentrate specific amino acids, sugars, and other molecular species, while potentially enhancing their thermal stabilities.

abstract = {We present a comparison between two different approaches to parallelizing the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation technique (GCMC) for classical fluids: a spatial decomposition and a time decomposition. The spatial decomposition relies on the fact that for short-ranged fluids, such as the cut and shifted Lennard-Jones potential used in this work, atoms separated by a greater distance than the reach of the potential act independently, and thus different processors can work concurrently in regions of the same system which are sufficiently far apart. The time decomposition is an exactly parallel approach which employs simultaneous (GCMC) simulations, one per processor, identical in every respect except the initial random number seed, with the thermodynamic output variables averaged across all processors. While scaling characteristics for the spatial decomposition are presented for 8-1024 processor systems, the comparison between the two decompositions is limited to the 8-128 processor range due to the warm-up time and memory imitations of the time decomposition. Using a combination of speed and statistical efficiency, the two algorithms are compared at two different state points. While the time decomposition reaches a given value of standard error in the system's potential energy more quickly than the spatial decomposition for both densities, the warm-up time demands of the time decomposition quickly become insurmountable as the system size increases.

A drawback of recently reported synthetic routes to RNA is the requirement for enantioenriched reactants, which fails to address the puzzle of how the single chirality of biological molecules arose. Here, we report the synthesis of highly enantioenriched RNA precursor molecules from racemic starting materials, with the molecular asymmetry derived solely from a small initial imbalance of the amino-acid enantiomers present in the reaction mixture. Acting as spectators to the main reaction chemistry, the amino acids orchestrate a sequence of physical and chemical amplification processes. The emergence of molecules of single chirality from complex, multi-component mixtures supports the robustness of this synthesis process under potential prebiotic conditions and provides a plausible explanation for the single-handedness of biological molecules before the emergence of self-replicating informational polymers.},

Much progress has been made in enumerating and characterizing the packing of polyhedral shapes, and the self-assembly of polyhedral nanocrystals into ordered superstructures. However, directing the self-assembly of polyhedral nanocrystals into densest packings requires precise control of particle shape, polydispersity, interactions and driving forces. Here we show with experiment and computer simulation that a range of nanoscale Ag polyhedra can self-assemble into their conjectured densest packings. When passivated with adsorbing polymer, the polyhedra behave as quasi-hard particles and assemble into millimetre-sized three-dimensional supercrystals by sedimentation. We also show, by inducing depletion attraction through excess polymer in solution, that octahedra form an exotic superstructure with complex helical motifs rather than the densest Minkowski lattice. Such large-scale Ag supercrystals may facilitate the design of scalable three-dimensional plasmonic metamaterials for sensing, nanophotonics and photocatalysis.},

abstract = {Using Monte Carlo simulation, we study a fluid of two-dimensional hard rods inside a small circular cavity bounded by a hard wall, from the dilute regime to the high-density, layering regime. Both planar and homeotropic anchoring of the nematic director can be induced at the walls through a free-energy penalty. The circular geometry creates frustration in the nematic phase and a polar-symmetry configuration with a distorted director field plus two \$+1/2\$ disclinations is created. At higher densities, a quasi-uniform structure is observed with a (minimal) director distortion which is relaxed via the formation of orientational domain walls. This novel structure is not predicted by elasticity theory and is similar to the step-like structures observed in three-dimensional hybrid slit pores. We speculate that the formation of domain walls is a general mechanism to relax elastic stresses in conditions of strong surface anchoring and severe spatial confinement.},

Polymersomes densely packed with magnetic nanoparticles in the polymersome membrane (magneto-polymersome) were fabricated with a series of different sized iron oxide nanoparticles. The distribution of nanoparticles in a polymersome membrane was size-dependent; while small nanoparticles were dispersed in a polymer bilayer, large particles formed a well-ordered superstructure at the interface between the inner and outer layer of a bilayer membrane. The yield of magneto-polymersomes increased with increasing the diameter of incorporated nanoparticles. Moreover, the size of the polymersomes was effectively controlled by varying the size of incorporated nanoparticles. This size-dependent self-assembly was attributed to the polymer chain entropy effect and the size-dependent localization of nanoparticles in polymersome bilayers. The transverse relaxation rates (r2) of magneto-polymersomes increased with increasing the nanoparticle diameter and decreasing the size of polymersomes, reaching 555 ± 24 s(-1) mM(-1) for 241 ± 16 nm polymersomes, which is the highest value reported to date for superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Adsorption of flexible oligomers into narrow cylindrical pores has been studied by means of several versions of classical density functional theory (CDFT) and Monte Carlo simulation. The adsorption process is interesting to study due to the competition between the entropic depletion of oligomers from the pores and the wall–oligomer attraction. It is also challenging to describe using current CDFTs, which tend to overestimate the amount of the adsorbed fluid. From a comparison of several different CDFT approaches, we find that this is due to the assumption of ideal or freely jointed chain conformations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that it is impossible to obtain a reasonable description of the adsorption isotherms without taking into account accurate contact values in the distribution functions describing the structure of the reference monomer fluid. At low densities, more accurate result are obtained in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation data when accurate contact values are incorporated into the theory rather than the more commonly used hard-sphere contact value. However, even the CDFT with accurate contact values still overestimates the amount of the adsorbed fluid due to the ideal or freely jointed chain approximation, used for the description of chain conformations in most CDFT approaches. We find that significant improvement can achieved by employing self-consistent field theory, which samples self-avoiding chain conformations and decreases the number of possible chain conformations, and, consequently, the amount of the adsorbed fluid.},

abstract = {Particles interacting with short-ranged potentials have attracted increasing interest, partly for their ability to model mesoscale systems such as colloids interacting via DNA or depletion. We consider the free-energy landscape of such systems as the range of the potential goes to zero. In this limit, the landscape is entirely defined by geometrical manifolds, plus a single control parameter. These manifolds are fundamental objects that do not depend on the details of the interaction potential and provide the starting point from which any quantity characterizing the system--equilibrium or nonequilibrium--can be computed for arbitrary potentials. To consider dynamical quantities we compute the asymptotic limit of the Fokker-Planck equation and show that it becomes restricted to the low-dimensional manifolds connected by "sticky" boundary conditions. To illustrate our theory, we compute the low-dimensional manifolds for n ≤ 8 identical particles, providing a complete description of the lowest-energy parts of the landscape including floppy modes with up to 2 internal degrees of freedom. The results can be directly tested on colloidal clusters. This limit is a unique approach for understanding energy landscapes, and our hope is that it can also provide insight into finite-range potentials.},

abstract = {Recent experimental advances have opened up the possibility of equilibrium self-assembly of functionalized nanoblocks with a high degree of controllable specific interactions. Here, we propose design principles for selecting the short-range interactions between self-assembling components to maximize yield. We illustrate the approach with an example from colloidal engineering. We construct an optimal set of local interactions for eight colloidal particles (coated, e.g., with DNA strands) to assemble into a particular polytetrahedral cluster. Maximum yield is attained when the interactions between the colloids follow the design rules: All energetically favorable interactions have the same strength, as do all unfavorable ones, and the number of components and energies fall within the proposed range. In general, it might be necessary to use more component than strictly required for enforcing the ground state configuration. The results motivate design strategies for engineering components that can reliably self-assemble.},

The long chain C(18)-im with increasing AgNO(3) concentration leads to a progressive truncation of octahedrons at \{100\} vertices to produce cubes. On the other hand, increasing the concentrations of C(1)-im and AgNO(3), results in a progressive truncation of octahedrons at \{110\} edges to give rhombic dodecahedrons, which further transform to the unprecedented tetrahexahedrons. The phenomenon could be understood by considering that while both C(18)-im and C(1)-im function as a capping agent with preferential adsorption on Au \{111\} facets, Ag(+) adsorbs and is subsequently reduced to Ag on Au \{110\} facets for the sterically demanding C(18)-im, but on the Au \{100\} facets for C(1)-im. The competition between the growth of the facets protected by imidazole and Ag controls the morphology transformation via truncation of octahedrons at vertices or edges.},

abstract = {Controllable self-assembly of uniform star-shaped PbS nanocrystals with six symmetric 100-oriented horns into highly ordered structures including close-packed arrays and patterned arrays was realized by evaporation-induced assembly routes. First, large-area three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal close-packed (hcp) arrays of PbS nanostars were assembled on clean Si substrate by drop coating and vertical deposition, respectively. Then, by using monolayer colloidal crystals (MCC) and inverted MCC (IMCC) as the template, a variety of non-close-packed (ncp) arrays of PbS nanostars with controllable patterns were fabricated through the vertical deposition method. With the MCC template, an ncp array of [111]-oriented PbS nanostars with three horns stably standing on the template plane was prepared, leading to the formation of novel star-sphere binary colloidal crystals with a stoichiometric star/sphere ratio of 1. The reflectance spectrum of the resultant MCC-PbS composite array was measured, which exhibited a considerable red shift in the reflectance peak compared with the original MCC template. Alternatively, with the IMCC template, an ncp array of [001]-oriented PbS nanostars with a single horn stretched vertically upward was obtained. Furthermore, some novel patterns for PbS ncp arrays were readily fabricated using MCC/IMCC templates with larger periodic spacings. For the template-assisted assembly of PbS nanostars, the obtained PbS ncp arrays generally inherited the long-range hexagonal order from the initial MCC template. This assembly strategy is a versatile approach and may open a new route for the controlled assembly of anisotropic nanostructured materials into large-scale ordered arrays with desirable patterns.},

abstract = {The surprising recent discoveries of quasicrystals and their approximants in soft-matter systems poses the intriguing possibility that these structures can be realized in a broad range of nanoscale and microscale assemblies. It has been theorized that soft-matter quasicrystals and approximants are largely entropically stabilized, but the thermodynamic mechanism underlying their formation remains elusive. Here, we use computer simulation and free-energy calculations to demonstrate a simple design heuristic for assembling quasicrystals and approximants in soft-matter systems. Our study builds on previous simulation studies of the self-assembly of dodecagonal quasicrystals and approximants in minimal systems of spherical particles with complex, highly specific interaction potentials. We demonstrate an alternative entropy-based approach for assembling dodecagonal quasicrystals and approximants based solely on particle functionalization and shape, thereby recasting the interaction-potential-based assembly strategy in terms of simpler-to-achieve bonded and excluded-volume interactions. Here, spherical building blocks are functionalized with mobile surface entities to encourage the formation of structures with low surface contact area, including non-close-packed and polytetrahedral structures. The building blocks also possess shape polydispersity, where a subset of the building blocks deviate from the ideal spherical shape, discouraging the formation of close-packed crystals. We show that three different model systems with both of these features-mobile surface entities and shape polydispersity-consistently assemble quasicrystals and/or approximants. We argue that this design strategy can be widely exploited to assemble quasicrystals and approximants on the nanoscale and microscale. In addition, our results further elucidate the formation of soft-matter quasicrystals in experiment.},

abstract = {I consider a generic coarse-grained model suitable for the study of bulk self-assembly of liquid crystal (LC) macromolecules. The cases include LC dendrimers, gold nanoparticles modified by polymer chains with terminating LC groups and others. The study is focused on the relation between a number of grafted chains, \$N\_\{\backslash rm ch\}\$, and the symmetry of the self-assembled bulk phases. Simple space-filling arguments are used first to estimate stability intervals for a rod-like, disc-like and spherulitic conformations in terms of \$N\_\{\backslash rm ch\}\$. These are followed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for both spontaneous and aided self-assembly of LC macromolecules into bulk phases. In spontaneous self-assembly runs, essential coexistence of rod-like and disc-like conformations is observed (via analysis of the histograms for the molecular asphericity) in a broad interval of \$N\_\{\backslash rm ch\}\$, which prevents the formation of defect-free structures. The use of uniaxial and planar aiding fields is found to improve self-assembly into monodomain phases by promoting conformations of respective symmetry. Strong shape-phase relation, observed experimentally, is also indicated by the simulations by the coincidence of the stability intervals for the respective conformations with those for the bulk phases.},

abstract = {Understanding the effect of curvature and topological frustration in crystals yields insights into the fragility of the ordered state. For instance, a one-dimensional crystal of identical charged particles can accommodate an extra particle (interstitial) if all the particle positions are readjusted, yet in a planar hexagonal crystal interstitials remain trapped between lattice sites and diffuse by hopping. Using optical tweezers operated independently of three-dimensional imaging, we inserted interstitials in a lattice of similar colloidal particles sitting on flat or curved oil/glycerol interfaces, and imaged the ensuing dynamics. We find that, unlike in flat space, the curved crystals self-heal through a collective particle rearrangement that redistributes the increased density associated with the interstitial. This process can be interpreted in terms of the out-of-equilibrium interaction of topological defects with each other and with the underlying curvature. Our observations suggest the existence of particle fractionalization on curved surface crystals.},

abstract = {Dislocations, disclinations, and grain boundaries are topological excitations of crystals that play a key role in determining out-of-equilibrium material properties. In this article we study the kinetics, creation, and annihilation processes of these defects in a controllable way by applying "topological tweezers," an array of weak optical tweezers which strain the lattice by weakly pulling on a collection of particles without grabbing them individually. We use topological tweezers to deterministically control individual dislocations and grain boundaries, and reversibly create and destroy dislocation pairs in a 2D crystal of charged colloids. Starting from a perfect lattice, we exert a torque on a finite region and follow the complete step-by-step creation of a disoriented grain, from the creation of dislocation pairs through their reactions to form a grain boundary and their reduction of elastic energy. However, when the grain is rotated back to its original orientation the dislocation reactions do not retrace. Rather, the process is irreversible; the grain boundary expands instead of collapsing.},

abstract = {Creating lightweight, mechanically robust materials has long been an engineering pursuit. Many siliceous skeleton species-such as diatoms, sea sponges and radiolarians-have remarkably high strengths when compared with man-made materials of the same composition, yet are able to remain lightweight and porous. It has been suggested that these properties arise from the hierarchical arrangement of different structural elements at their relevant length scales. Here, we report the fabrication of hollow ceramic scaffolds that mimic the length scales and hierarchy of biological materials. The constituent solids attain tensile strengths of 1.75 GPa without failure even after multiple deformation cycles, as revealed by in situ nanomechanical experiments and finite-element analysis. We discuss the high strength and lack of failure in terms of stress concentrators at surface imperfections and of local stresses within the microstructural landscape. Our findings suggest that the hierarchical design principles offered by hard biological organisms can be applied to create damage-tolerant lightweight engineering materials.},

abstract = {The impact of particle geometry on the phase behavior of hard colloidal tetragonal parallelepipeds (TPs) was studied by using Monte Carlo simulations in continuum space. TPs or "cuboids" of aspect ratios varying from 0.25 to 8 were simulated by approximating their shapes with multisite objects, i.e., via rigid clusters of hard spheres. Using equation of state curves, order parameters, radial distribution functions, particle distribution functions along three directions, and visual analysis of configurations, an approximate phase diagram for the TPs was mapped out as a function of aspect ratio (r) and volume fraction. For r > 3 and intermediate concentrations, the behavior of the TPs was similar to that of spherocylinders, exhibiting similar liquid crystalline mesophases (e.g., nematic and smectic phases). For r = 1, a cubatic phase occurs with orientational order along the three axes but with little translational order. For 1 < r < 4, the TPs exhibit a cubatic-like mesophase with a high degree of order along three axes where the major axes of the particles are not all aligned in the same direction. For r < 1, the TPs exhibit a smectic-like phase where the particles have rotational freedom in each layer but form stacks with tetratic order. The equation of state for perfect hard cubes (r = 1) was also simulated and found to be consistent with that of the rounded-edge r = 1 TPs, except for its lack of discontinuity at the cubatic-solid transition.},

abstract = {The phase behavior of suspensions of colloidal hard tetragonal parallelepipeds ("TPs") (also known as rectangular nanorods or nanobars) was studied by using Monte Carlo simulations to gain a detailed understanding of the effect of flat-faceted particles on inducing regular local packing and long range structural order. A TP particle has orthogonal sides with lengths a, b, and c, such that a=b and its aspect ratio is r=c/a. The phase diagram for such perfect TPs was mapped out for particle aspect ratios ranging from 0.125 to 5.0. Equation of state curves, order parameters, particle distribution functions, and snapshots were used to analyze the resulting phases. Given the athermal nature of the systems studied, it is the interplay of purely entropic forces that drives phase transitions amongst the structures observed that include crystal, columnar, smectic, parquet, and isotropic phases. In the parquet phase that occurs for 0.54<r< or =3.2, for example, the particles possess some translational entropy (mobility) but reduced orientational entropy; particles arrange in stacks oriented perpendicular to one another, so that all particle axes are aligned along three common directors. Multicanonical-type simulations were used to study in more detail the isotropic-parquet phase transition. Both similarities and differences were identified between the results for these perfect TPs and those unveiled in our previous study of approximate (polybead) TPs.},

abstract = {The formation of crystals from solution requires the initial self-assembly of units of matter into stable periodic structures reaching a critical size1-3. The early stages of this process -called nucleation- are very difficult to visualize4-12. Here we describe a novel method that allows real time observation of the dynamics of nucleation and dissolution of sodium chlorate clusters in an ionic liquid solution using in-situ transmission electron microscopy. Using ionic liquids as solvent circumvents the problem of evaporation and charging, while the nucleation frequency was reduced by using saturated solutions. We observe simultaneous formation and dissolution of prenucleation clusters, suggesting that high-density fluctuations leading to solid cluster formation exist even under equilibrium conditions. In-situ electron diffraction patterns reveal the simultaneous formation of crystalline nuclei of two polymorphic structures - the stable low-temperature cubic phase and the high-temperature monoclinic phase - during the earliest stages of nucleation. These results demonstrate that molecules in solution can form clusters of different polymorphic phases independently of their respective solubility.},

abstract = {Bacterial growth is crucially dependent on protein synthesis and thus on the cellular abundance of ribosomes and related proteins. Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

Here, we present an alternative membrane-free model, which demonstrates that low-molecular-weight mononucleotides and simple cationic peptides spontaneously accumulate in water into microdroplets that are stable to changes in temperature and salt concentration, undergo pH-induced cycles of growth and decay, and promote $\alpha$-helical peptide secondary structure. Moreover, the microdroplets selectively sequester porphyrins, inorganic nanoparticles and enzymes to generate supramolecular stacked arrays of light-harvesting molecules, nanoparticle-mediated oxidase activity, and enhanced rates of glucose phosphorylation, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that peptide-nucleotide microdroplets can be considered as a new type of protocell model that could be used to develop novel bioreactors, primitive artificial cells and plausible pathways to prebiotic organization before the emergence of lipid-based compartmentalization on the early Earth.},

abstract = {A pentagonal order formed by 360 proteins in the bovine papilloma viral capsid and structures of some smaller viral capsids are considered from a unified point of view based on the Landau crystallization theory. To simulate the capsid structures we map the planar pentagonal Penrose quasilattice (PPQ) constructed in the frames of the Landau theory onto a sphere through the dodecahedron nets of different sizes. Six different simplest nets containing from 60 to 360 positions occupied by proteins are proposed. Buckling of the initially planar capsid faces and a smooth conjugation of the protein orders at the adjacent faces are taken into account by means of two conditions imposed on the minimization of the capsid free energy. This conditional minimization results in two-component phason strain field, which describes the self-consistent reconstruction of quasicrystalline orders located at twelve faces of spherical dodecahedron. All six chiral structures obtained in this way are very similar to those of well-known spherical viral capsids. The theory proposed explains some general peculiarities of protein organization in capsids of small and medium-sized viruses.},

abstract = {Here, we report an engineering approach toward multicomponent self-assembly processes by developing a methodology to circumvent spurious, metastable assemblies. The formation of metastable aggregates often hampers self-assembly of molecular building blocks into the desired nanostructures. Strategies are explored to master the pathway complexity and avoid off-pathway aggregates by optimizing the rate of assembly along the correct pathway. We study as a model system the coassembly of two monomers, the R- and S-chiral enantiomers of a \{pi\}-conjugated oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) derivative. Coassembly kinetics are analyzed by developing a kinetic model, which reveals the initial assembly of metastable structures buffering free monomers and thereby slows the formation of thermodynamically stable assemblies. These metastable assemblies exert greater influence on the thermodynamically favored self-assembly pathway if the ratio between both monomers approaches 1:1, in agreement with experimental results. Moreover, competition by metastable assemblies is highly temperature dependent and hampers the assembly of equilibrium nanostructures most effectively at intermediate temperatures. We demonstrate that the rate of the assembly process may be optimized by tuning the cooling rate. Finally, it is shown by simulation that increasing the driving force for assembly stepwise by changing the solvent composition may circumvent metastable pathways and thereby force the assembly process directly into the correct pathway.},

The parallel scheme is directly applicable to a wide range of stochastic cellular automata where the discrete events (updates) are Poisson arrivals. For high performance, we utilize a continuous-time, asynchronous parallel version of the n-fold way rejection-free algorithm. Each processing element carries an lxl block of spins, and we employ the fast SHMEM-library routines on the Cray T3E distributed-memory parallel architecture. Different processing elements have different local simulated times. To ensure causality, the algorithm handles the asynchrony in a conservative fashion. Despite relatively low utilization and an intricate relationship between the average time increment and the size of the spin blocks, we find that for sufficiently large l the algorithm outperforms its corresponding parallel Metropolis (non-rejection-free) counterpart. As an example application, we present results for metastable decay in a model ferromagnetic or ferroelectric film, observed with a probe of area smaller than the total system.},

In order to investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions in the collective behavior of an active fluid, we choose a model system: paramagnetic particles submerged in water and activated by an oscillating magnetic field. The magnetic field induces magnetic attractions among the paramagnetic particles, activating the particles, and injecting energy into the fluid. Over many cycles, the particles aggregate together and form clusters. In order to form clusters, however, the particles must overcome viscous drag. We investigate the relative roles of viscosity and magnetism. When the role of viscosity is important, the particles cannot form large clusters. But when the role of magnetism is important, the particles rapidly form organized, large clusters. Our results shown in this fluid dynamics video suggest that viscous stresses slow the clustering rate and decrease the size of clusters in a self-assembling colloidal system.},

A complete physical picture of those phenomena is of definite importance to the understanding of biological cooperative motions of cilia and flagella. Moreover, it can potentially suggest novel routes to exploit synchronization in technological applications of soft matter. We demonstrate that driving colloidal particles in rotating energy landscapes results in a strong tendency towards synchronization, favouring states where all beads rotate in phase. The resulting dynamics can be described in terms of activated jumps with transition rates that are strongly affected by hydrodynamics leading to an increased probability and lifetime of the synchronous states.

Cross-linked polystyrene spheres with a liquid protrusion were found to assemble into colloidal molecules by coalescence of the liquid protrusions. Similarly, cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) particles carrying a wetting layer assembled into colloidal molecules by coalescence of the wetting layer. Driven by surface energy, a liquid droplet on which the solid spheres are attached is formed. Subsequent polymerization of the liquid yields a wide variety of colloidal molecules as well as colloidosomes with tunable patchiness. Precise control over the topology of the particles has been achieved by changing the amount and nature of the swelling monomer as well as the wetting angle between the liquid and the seed particles. The overall cluster size can be controlled by the seed size as well as the swelling ratio. Use of different swelling monomers and/or particles allows for chemical diversity of the patches and the center. For low swelling ratios assemblies of small numbers of seeds resemble clusters that minimize the second moment of the mass distribution. Assemblies comprised of a large number of colloids are similar to colloidosomes exhibiting elastic strain relief by scar formation.},

abstract = {The construction of a protocell from a materials point of view is important in understanding the origin of life. Both self-reproduction of a compartment and self-replication of an informational substance have been studied extensively, but these processes have typically been carried out independently, rather than linked to one another. Here, we demonstrate the amplification of DNA (encapsulated guest) within a self-reproducible cationic giant vesicle (host). With the addition of a vesicular membrane precursor, we observe the growth and spontaneous division of the giant vesicles, accompanied by distribution of the DNA to the daughter giant vesicles. In particular, amplification of the DNA accelerated the division of the giant vesicles. This means that self-replication of an informational substance has been linked to self-reproduction of a compartment through the interplay between polyanionic DNA and the cationic vesicular membrane. Our self-reproducing giant vesicle system therefore represents a step forward in the construction of an advanced model protocell.},

@article{Lazcano2010,
abstract = {Following the publication of the Origin of Species in 1859, many naturalists adopted the idea that living organisms were the historical outcome of gradual transformation of lifeless matter. These views soon merged with the developments of biochemistry and cell biology and led to proposals in which the origin of protoplasm was equated with the origin of life. The heterotrophic origin of life proposed by Oparin and Haldane in the 1920s was part of this tradition, which Oparin enriched by transforming the discussion of the emergence of the first cells into a workable multidisciplinary research program. On the other hand, the scientific trend toward understanding biological phenomena at the molecular level led authors like Troland, Muller, and others to propose that single molecules or viruses represented primordial living systems. The contrast between these opposing views on the origin of life represents not only contrasting views of the nature of life itself, but also major ideological discussions that reached a surprising intensity in the years following Stanley Miller's seminal result which showed the ease with which organic compounds of biochemical significance could be synthesized under putative primitive conditions. In fact, during the years following the Miller experiment, attempts to understand the origin of life were strongly influenced by research on DNA replication and protein biosynthesis, and, in socio-political terms, by the atmosphere created by Cold War tensions. The catalytic versatility of RNA molecules clearly merits a critical reappraisal of Muller's viewpoint. However, the discovery of ribozymes does not imply that autocatalytic nucleic acid molecules ready to be used as primordial genes were floating in the primitive oceans, or that the RNA world emerged completely assembled from simple precursors present in the prebiotic soup. The evidence supporting the presence of a wide range of organic molecules on the primitive Earth, including membrane-forming compounds, suggests that the evolution of membrane-bounded molecular systems preceded cellular life on our planet, and that life is the evolutionary outcome of a process, not of a single, fortuitous event.},

Regarding artificial quasicrystals for electromagnetic waves, three-dimensional (3D) structures have recently been realized at GHz frequencies and 2D structures have been reported for the near-infrared region. Here, we report on the first fabrication and characterization of 3D quasicrystals for infrared frequencies. Using direct laser writing combined with a silicon inversion procedure, we achieve high-quality silicon inverse icosahedral structures. Both polymeric and silicon quasicrystals are characterized by means of electron microscopy and visible-light Laue diffraction. The diffraction patterns of structures with a local five-fold real-space symmetry axis reveal a ten-fold symmetry as required by theory for 3D structures.},

This structure, referred to as the sigma ($\sigma$) phase by Frank and Kasper more than 50 years ago, nucleates and grows from the body-centered cubic phase similar to its occurrence in metal alloys and is a crystal approximant to dodecagonal quasicrystals.

Contrary to this intuition, we report a dynamical competition between sedimentation and phase ordering which leads to smaller particles settling faster than larger ones. We access this phenomenon using suspensions of polymers and two colloidal species which we image with confocal microscopy. Polymers mediate attractions between colloids, leading to phase separation and crystallisation. We find that the dynamical interplay between sedimentation, phase separation and crystal nucleation underlie this phenomenon. Furthermore, under certain conditions we find a kinetic pathway leading to an apparent coexistence between a one component crystal and binary fluid of equal buoyancy. These findings may be relevant to the basic understanding of sedimentation-induced zone formation in nature and industrial applications.},

abstract = {Colloidal suspensions are widely used to study processes such as melting, freezing and glass transitions. This is because they display the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to observe them directly in real space. Another attractive feature is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range repulsive, short-range attractive, hard-sphere-like and dipolar, can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases. However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions (that is, ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal aggregation. Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals, confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged. Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced materials for photonic applications.},

In this work, it is shown how such simulations can be accelerated with the use of NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) using the CUDA programming architecture. We have developed two different algorithms for lattice spin models, the first useful for equilibrium properties near a second-order phase transition point and the second for dynamical slowing down near a glass transition. The algorithms are based on parallel MC techniques, and speedups from 70- to 150-fold over conventional single-threaded computer codes are obtained using consumer-grade hardware.},

Interest in structuring materials at this length scale, but with more complex features and ideally by self-assembly processes, has led to much progress in controlling features of both building blocks and assemblies. The necessary ingredients include colloids, colloidal clusters, and colloidal "molecules" which have special shapes and the ability to bind directionally, the control over short-range and long-range interactions, and the capability to place and orientate these bricks.

This ice-assisted movement is more efficient for such heavy-load and low-speed transportation necessary for the stones of the Forbidden City.

abstract = {The five-membered furanose ring is a central component of the chemical structure of biological nucleic acids. The conformations of the furanose ring can be analytically described using the concept of pseudorotation, and for RNA and DNA they are dominated by the C2'-endo and C3'-endo conformers. While the free energy difference between these two conformers can be inferred from NMR measurements, a free energy landscape of the complete pseudorotation cycle of nucleic acids in solution has remained elusive. Here, we describe a new free energy calculation method for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the two pseudorotation parameters directly as the collective variables. To validate our approach, we calculated the free energy surface of ribose pseudorotation in guanosine and 2'-deoxyguanosine. The calculated free energy landscape reveals not only the relative stability of the different pseudorotation conformers, but also the main transition path between the stable conformations. Applying this method to a standard A-form RNA duplex uncovered the expected minimum at the C3'-endo state. However, at a 2'-5' linkage, the minimum shifts to the C2'-endo conformation. The free energy of the C3'-endo conformation is 3 kcal/mol higher due to a weaker hydrogen bond and a reduced base stacking interaction. Unrestrained MD simulations suggest that the conversion from C3'-endo to C2'-endo and vice versa is on the nanosecond and microsecond time scale, respectively. These calculations suggest that 2'-5' linkages may enable folded RNAs to sample a wider spectrum of their pseudorotation conformations.},

abstract = {The selectivity of DNA recognition inspires an elegant protocol for designing versatile nanoparticle (NP) assemblies. We use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze dynamic aspects of the assembly process and identify ingredients that are key to a successful assembly of NP superlattices through DNA hybridization. A scale-accurate coarse-grained model faithfully captures the relevant contributions to the kinetics of the DNA hybridization process and is able to recover all experimentally reported to date binary superlattices (BCC, CsCl, AlB2, Cr3Si, and Cs6C60). We study the assembly mechanism in systems with up to 10(6) degrees of freedom and find that the crystallization process is accompanied with a slight decrease of enthalpy. Furthermore, we find that the optimal range of the DNA linker interaction strengths for a successful assembly is 12-16kBT, and the optimal mean lifetime of a DNA hybridization event is 10(-4)-10(-3) of the total time it takes to form a crystal. We also obtain the optimal percentage of hybridized DNA pairs for different binary systems. On the basis of these results, we propose suitable linker sequences for future nanomaterials design.},

Plastic crystals/glasses are characterized by long-ranged positional order/frozen-in-disorder but short-ranged orientational order, which is dynamic. Here we show by quantitative three-dimensional studies that charged rod-like colloidal particles form three-dimensional plastic crystals and glasses if their repulsions extend significantly beyond their length. These plastic phases can be reversibly switched to full crystals by an electric field. These new phases provide insight into the role of rotations in phase behaviour and could be useful for photonic applications.},

abstract = {Although an analogy has been drawn between them, organic molecular amphiphiles (MAMs) and inorganic nanoparticle (NP) amphiphiles (NPAMs) are significantly different in dimension, geometry, and composition as well as their assembly behavior. Their concurrent assembly can synergetically combine the inherent properties of both building blocks, thus leading to new hybrid materials with increasing complexity and functionality. Here we present a new strategy to fabricate hybrid vesicles with well-defined shape, morphology and surface pattern by co-assembling MAMs of block copolymers (BCPs) and NPAMs comprising inorganic NPs tethered with amphiphilic BCPs. The assembly of binary mixtures generated unique hybrid Janus-like vesicles with different shapes, patchy vesicles, and heterogeneous vesicles. Our experimental and computational studies indicate that the different nanostructures arise from the delicate interplay between the dimension mismatch of the two types of amphiphiles, the entanglement of polymer chains, and the mobility of NPAMs. In addition, the entropic attraction between NPAMs plays a dominant role in controlling the lateral phase separation of the two types of amphiphiles in the membranes. The ability to utilize multiple distinct amphiphiles to construct discrete assemblies represents a promising step in the self-assembly of structurally complex functional materials.},

The spacing of the channel follows a simple scaling law that can be theoretically justified, and the kinetics of healing is rate limited by fluid flow, but with a non-trivial dependence on the substrate thickness that likely arises due to channelization.

By using external fields (such as shear flow, electric, magnetic or laseroptical fields as well as confinement), a colloidal suspension can be brought into nonequilibrium in a controlled way.

abstract = {A definition for a class of asynchronous cellular arrays is proposed. An example of such asynchrony would be independent Poisson arrivals of cell iterations. The Ising model in the continuous time formulation of Glauber falls into this class. Also proposed are efficient parallel algorithms for simulating these asynchronous cellular arrays. In the algorithms, one or several cells are assigned to a processing element (PE), local times for different PEs can be different. Although the standard serial algorithm by Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller can simulate such arrays, it is usually believed to be without an efficient parallel counterpart. However, the proposed parallel algorithms contradict this belief proving to be both efficient and able to perform the same task as the standard algorithm. The results of experiments with the new algorithms are encouraging: the speed-up is greater than 16 using 25 PEs on a shared memory MIMD bus computer, and greater than 1900 using 214 PEs on a SIMD computer. The algorithm by Bortz, Kalos, and Lebowitz can be incorporated in the proposed parallel algorithms, further contributing to speed-up. In this paper I invented the update-cites-of-local-time-minima parallel simulation scheme. Now the scheme is becoming popular.

A rich variety of structures for the phase separated brushes is predicted. Phase diagrams involving a series of system parameters, such as the aspect ratio of the nanorod, the grafting density, and the chain length are constructed. The results indicate that the phase structure of the mixed brush-rod system can be tailored by varying the grafted chain length and/or the aspect ratio of the rod to benefit the fabrication of polymeric nanocomposites.},

abstract = {High speed stirring at elevated temperatures is shown to be effective in the symmetry breaking process needed for the growth of the hard-to-synthesize silver nanorods from the polyol reduction of silver ions. This process competes with the facile formation of more symmetrical, spherical and cubic, nanoparticles. Once the seed is formed, further growth proceeds predominantly along the long axis, with a consequent increase of the particles' aspect ratio (that of the nanorod). When stirring is stopped shortly after seed formation, nanorods with a broad distribution of aspect ratios are obtained, while when the high-frequency stirring continues the distribution narrows significantly. The width of the nanorods can only be increased if the initial concentration of Ag+ ions increases. Reducing the stirring speeds during seed formation lowers the yield of nanorods. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of a nanometer-scale thin boundary region between a solid facet of the nanoparticle and the liquid around it, and the accommodation processes of metal (Ag) atoms transported through this boundary region from the liquid to the solid growth interface, are frustrated by sufficiently fast shear flow caused by high-frequency stirring. This arrests growth on seed facets parallel to the flow, leading, together with the preferential binding of the capping polymer to the (100) facet, to the observed growth in the (110) direction, resulting in silver nanorods capped at the ends by (111) facets and exposing (100) facets on the side walls.},

These 'photonic crystals' allow researchers to modify the interaction between electromagnetic fields and dielectric media from radio to optical wavelengths. Their technological potential, such as the inhibition of spontaneous emission, enhancement of semiconductor lasers, and integration and miniaturization of optical components, makes the search for an easy-to-craft photonic crystal with a large bandgap a major field of study. This progress article surveys a collection of robust complete three-dimensional dielectric photonic-bandgap structures for the visible and near-infrared regimes based on the diamond morphology together with their specific fabrication techniques. The basic origin of the complete photonic bandgap for the 'champion' diamond morphology is described in terms of dielectric modulations along principal directions. Progress in three-dimensional interference lithography for fabrication of near-champion diamond-based structures is also discussed.},

abstract = {We study the dynamical arrest in an adhesive hard-sphere colloidal system. We examine a micellar suspension of the Pluronic-L64 surfactant in the temperature (T) and volume fraction (ϕ) phase diagram. According to mode-coupling theory (MCT), this system is characterized by a cusp-like singularity and two glassy phases: an attractive glass (AG) phase and a repulsive glass (RG) phase. The T − ϕ phase diagram of this system as confirmed by a previous series of scattering data also exhibits a Percolation Threshold (PT) line, a reentrant behavior (AG-liquid-RG), and a glass-to-glass transition. The AG phase can be generated out of the liquid phase by using T and ϕ as control parameters. We utilize viscosity and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. NMR data confirm all the characteristic properties of the colloidal system phase diagram and give evidence of the onset of a fractal-like percolating structure at a precise threshold. The MCT scaling laws used to study the shear viscosity as a function of ϕ and T show in both cases a fragile-to-strong liquid glass-forming dynamic crossover (FSC) located near the percolation threshold where the clustering process is fully developed. These results suggest a larger thermodynamic generality for this phenomenon, which is usually studied only as a function of the temperature. We also find that the critical values of the control parameters, coincident with the PT line, define the locus of the FSC. In the region between the FSC and the glass transition lines the system dynamics are dominated by clustering effects. We thus demonstrate that it is possible, using the conceptual framework provided by extended mode-coupling theory, to describe the way a system approaches dynamic arrest, taking into account both cage and hopping effects.},

abstract = {Quasicrystalline structures may have optical bandgap properties-frequency ranges in which the propagation of light is forbidden-that make them well-suited to the scientific and technological applications for which photonic crystals are normally considered. Such quasicrystals can be constructed from two or more types of dielectric material arranged in a quasiperiodic pattern whose rotational symmetry is forbidden for periodic crystals (such as five-fold symmetry in the plane and icosahedral symmetry in three dimensions). Because quasicrystals have higher point group symmetry than ordinary crystals, their gap centre frequencies are closer and the gaps widths are more uniform-optimal conditions for forming a complete bandgap that is more closely spherically symmetric. Although previous studies have focused on one-dimensional and two-dimensional quasicrystals, where exact (one-dimensional) or approximate (two-dimensional) band structures can be calculated numerically, analogous calculations for the three-dimensional case are computationally challenging and have not yet been performed. Here we circumvent the computational problem by doing an experiment. Using stereolithography, we construct a photonic quasicrystal with centimetre-scale cells and perform microwave transmission measurements. We show that three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals exhibit sizeable stop gaps and, despite their quasiperiodicity, yield uncomplicated spectra that allow us to experimentally determine the faces of their effective Brillouin zones. Our studies confirm that they are excellent candidates for photonic bandgap materials.},

abstract = {Phenotypic polarization of macrophages is regulated by a milieu of cues in the local tissue microenvironment. Although much is known about how soluble factors influence macrophage polarization, relatively little is known about how physical cues present in the extracellular environment might modulate proinflammatory (M1) vs. prohealing (M2) activation. Specifically, the role of cell shape has not been explored, even though it has been observed that macrophages adopt different geometries in vivo. We and others observed that macrophages polarized toward different phenotypes in vitro exhibit dramatic changes in cell shape: M2 cells exhibit an elongated shape compared with M1 cells. Using a micropatterning approach to control macrophage cell shape directly, we demonstrate here that elongation itself, without exogenous cytokines, leads to the expression of M2 phenotype markers and reduces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, elongation enhances the effects of M2-inducing cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and protects cells from M1-inducing stimuli LPS and IFN-\{gamma\}. In addition shape- but not cytokine-induced polarization is abrogated when actin and actin/myosin contractility are inhibited by pharmacological agents, suggesting a role for the cytoskeleton in the control of macrophage polarization by cell geometry. Our studies demonstrate that alterations in cell shape associated with changes in ECM architecture may provide integral cues to modulate macrophage phenotype polarization.},

abstract = {Although the effects of kinetics on crystal growth are well understood, the role of substrate curvature is not yet established. We studied rigid, two-dimensional colloidal crystals growing on spherical droplets to understand how the elastic stress induced by Gaussian curvature affects the growth pathway. In contrast to crystals grown on flat surfaces or compliant crystals on droplets, these crystals formed branched, ribbon-like domains with large voids and no topological defects. We show that this morphology minimizes the curvature-induced elastic energy. Our results illustrate the effects of curvature on the ubiquitous process of crystallization, with practical implications for nanoscale disorder-order transitions on curved manifolds, including the assembly of viral capsids, phase separation on vesicles, and crystallization of tetrahedra in three dimensions.},

Here we present experimental measurements of the structures and free energies of colloidal clusters in which the particles act as hard spheres with short-range attractions. We found that highly symmetric clusters are strongly suppressed by rotational entropy, whereas the most stable clusters have anharmonic vibrational modes or extra bonds. Many of these clusters are subsets of close-packed lattices. As the number of particles increases from 6 to 10, we observe the emergence of a complex free-energy landscape with a small number of ground states and many local minima.},

Within this class of particles, triangular Au and Ag nanoprisms stand out due to their structure- and environment-dependent optical features, their anisotropic surface energetics, and the emergence of reliable synthetic methods for producing them in bulk quantities with control over their edge lengths and thickness.

abstract = {A number of novel experimental and theoretical results have recently been obtained on active soft matter, demonstrating the various interesting universal and anomalous features of this kind of driven systems. Here we consider a fundamental but still unexplored aspect of the patterns arising in the system of actively moving units, i.e., their segregation taking place when two kinds of them with different adhesive properties are present. The process of segregation is studied by a model made of self-propelled particles such that the particles have a tendency to adhere only to those which are of the same kind. The calculations corresponding to the related differential equations can be made in parallel, thus a powerful GPU card allows large scale simulations. We find that the segregation kinetics is very different from the non-driven counterparts and is described by the new scaling exponents \$z\backslash simeq 1\$ and \$z\backslash simeq 0.8\$ for the 1:1 and the non-equal ratio of the two constituents, respectively. Our results are in agreement with a recent observation of segregating tissue cells $\backslash$emph\{in vitro\}.},

Retaining the spirit of the original work, this article draws analogy with nematic liquid-crystals, but instead of a static description, we present a dynamical (out-of-equilibrium) description. The approach combines nemato-hydrodynamics in the linear regime and a proper use of (differential-) geometry. The main result is to demonstrate that one can obtain equations describing a cross-diffusion effect (similar to the Soret and Dufour effects) between curvature and the flow of amphiphilic molecules. Surprisingly, the shape of a membrane relaxes according to a simple heat equation in the mean curvature: a process that is accompanied by a simultaneous boost to the diffusion of amphiphiles away from regions of high curvature. The model also predicts the inverse process, by which the forced bending of a membrane induces molecular flows towards areas of high curvature. In principle, numerical values for the relevant diffusion coefficients should be verifiable by experiment.},

abstract = {We investigate thermodynamic and structural properties of colloidal dumbbells in the framework provided by the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory of molecular fluids and Monte Carlo simulations. We consider two different models: in the first one we set identical square-well attractions on the two tangent spheres composing the molecule (SW-SW model); in the second scheme, one of square-well interactions is switched off (HS-SW model). Appreciable differences emerge between the physical properties of the two models. Specifically, the \$k \backslash to 0\$ behavior of SW-SW structure factors \$S(k)\$ points to the presence of a gas-liquid coexistence, as confirmed by subsequent fluid phase equilibria calculations. Conversely, the HS-SW \$S(k)\$ develops a low-\$k\$ peak, signaling the presence of aggregates; such a process destabilizes the gas-liquid phase separation, promoting at low temperatures the formation of a cluster phase, whose structure depends on the system density. We further investigate such differences by studying the phase behavior of a series of intermediate models, obtained from the original SW-SW by progressively reducing the depth of one square-well interaction. RISM structural predictions positively reproduce the simulation data, including the rise of \$S(k \backslash to 0\$) in the SW-SW model and the low-\$k\$ peak in the HS-SW structure factor. As for the phase behavior, RISM agrees with Monte Carlo simulations in predicting a gas-liquid coexistence for the SW-SW model (though the critical parameters appears overestimated by the theory) and its progressive disappearance moving toward the HS-SW model.},

abstract = {This feature article highlights work from the authors' laboratories on the synthesis, assembly, reactivity, and optical applications of metallic nanoparticles of nonspherical shape, especially nanorods. The synthesis is a seed-mediated growth procedure, in which metal salts are reduced initially with a strong reducing agent, in water, to produce approximately 4 nm seed particles. Subsequent reduction of more metal salt with a weak reducing agent, in the presence of structure-directing additives, leads to the controlled formation of nanorods of specified aspect ratio and can also yield other shapes of nanoparticles (stars, tetrapods, blocks, cubes, etc.). Variations in reaction conditions and crystallographic analysis of gold nanorods have led to insight into the growth mechanism of these materials. Assembly of nanorods can be driven by simple evaporation from solution or by rational design with molecular-scale connectors. Short nanorods appear to be more chemically reactive than long nanorods. Finally, optical applications in sensing and imaging, which take advantage of the visible light absorption and scattering properties of the nanorods, are discussed.},

We discover not only a stable face-centered cubic (fcc) plastic crystal phase for near-spherical particles, but also a stable body-centered cubic (bcc) plastic crystal close to the octahedron shape, and in fact even coexistence of these two plastic crystals with a substantial density gap. The plastic fcc and bcc crystals are, however, unstable in the cube and octahedron limit, suggesting that the rounded corners of superballs play an important role in stablizing the rotator phases. In addition, we observe a two-step melting phenomenon for hard octahedra, in which the Minkowski crystal melts into a metastable bcc plastic crystal before melting into the fluid phase.},

abstract = {Crystallization and vitrification are two different routes to form a solid. Normally these two processes suppress each other, with the glass transition preventing crystallization at high density (or low temperature). This is even true for systems of colloidal hard spheres, which are commonly used as building blocks for fabricating photonic crystals [1-3]. Here, by performing Brownian dynamics simulations of glass systems consisting of mixtures of active and passive hard spheres, we show that the crystallization of such hard-sphere glasses can be dramatically promoted by doping the system with small amounts of active particles. Surprisingly, even hard-sphere glasses of packing fraction up to \$\backslash phi = 0.635\$ crystallize, which is around 0.5\% below the random close packing \~{} 0.64. Our results suggest a novel way of fabricating crystalline materials from (colloidal) glasses. This is particularly important for materials that get easily kinetically trapped in glassy states, and crystal nucleation hardly occurs.},

We find that the spheres enhance the tunneling conductivity for a given concentration of rods and that the enhancement increases with rod concentration into the regime where the conducting network is well established. By reformulating the network of rods using a critical path analysis, we quantify the effect of depletion-induced attraction between the rods due to the spheres. Furthermore, we show that our conductivity data are quantitatively reproduced by an effective medium approximation, which explicitly relates the system tunneling conductance to the structure of the rod-sphere fluid.},

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials.},

abstract = {Pair distributions of fluids confined between two surfaces at close distance are of fundamental importance for a variety of physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, such as interactions between macromolecules in solution, surface forces, and diffusion in narrow pores. However, in contrast to bulk fluids, properties of inhomogeneous fluids are seldom studied at the pair-distribution level. Motivated by recent experimental advances in determining anisotropic structure factors of confined fluids, we analyze theoretically the underlying anisotropic pair distributions of the archetypical hard-sphere fluid confined between two parallel hard surfaces using first-principles statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous fluids. For this purpose, we introduce an experimentally accessible ensemble-averaged local density correlation function and study its behavior as a function of confining slit width. Upon increasing the distance between the confining surfaces, we observe an alternating sequence of strongly anisotropic versus more isotropic local order. The latter is due to packing frustration of the spherical particles. This observation highlights the importance of studying inhomogeneous fluids at the pair-distribution level.},

abstract = {Many nanometre-sized building blocks will readily assemble into macroscopic structures. If the process is accompanied by effective control over the interactions between the blocks and all entropic effects, then the resultant structures will be ordered with a precision hard to achieve with other fabrication methods. But it remains challenging to use self-assembly to design systems comprised of different types of building blocks-to realize novel magnetic, plasmonic and photonic metamaterials, for example. A conceptually simple idea for overcoming this problem is the use of 'encodable' interactions between building blocks; this can in principle be straightforwardly implemented using biomolecules. Strategies that use DNA programmability to control the placement of nanoparticles in one and two dimensions have indeed been demonstrated. However, our theoretical understanding of how to extend this approach to three dimensions is limited, and most experiments have yielded amorphous aggregates and only occasionally crystallites of close-packed micrometre-sized particles. Here, we report the formation of three-dimensional crystalline assemblies of gold nanoparticles mediated by interactions between complementary DNA molecules attached to the nanoparticles' surface. We find that the nanoparticle crystals form reversibly during heating and cooling cycles. Moreover, the body-centred-cubic lattice structure is temperature-tuneable and structurally open, with particles occupying only approximately 4\% of the unit cell volume. We expect that our DNA-mediated crystallization approach, and the insight into DNA design requirements it has provided, will facilitate both the creation of new classes of ordered multicomponent metamaterials and the exploration of the phase behaviour of hybrid systems with addressable interactions.},

abstract = {In canonical Monte Carlo simulations, sequential updating of particles is equivalent to random updating due to particle indistinguishability. In contrast, in grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, sequential implementation of the particle transfer steps in a dense grid of distinct points in space improves both the serial and the parallel efficiency of the simulation. The main advantage of sequential updating in parallel canonical Monte Carlo simulations is the reduction in interprocessor communication, which is usually a slow process. In this work, we propose a parallelization method for canonical Monte Carlo simulations via domain decomposition techniques and sequential updating of particles. Each domain is further divided into a middle and two outer sections. Information exchange is required after the completion of the updating of the outer regions. During the updating of the middle section, communication does not occur unless a particle moves out of this section. Results on two- and three-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluids indicate a nearly perfect improvement in parallel efficiency for large systems.},

In particular, we computationally search for nets within a large set of possibilities and then test these nets experimentally. Our main findings are that (i) compactness is a simple and effective design principle for maximizing the yield of self-folding polyhedra; and (ii) shortest paths from 2D nets to 3D polyhedra in the configuration space are important for rationalizing experimentally observed folding pathways. Our work provides a model problem amenable to experimental and theoretical analysis of design principles and pathways in self-assembly.},

By extensive Monte carlo simulations we find that with a finite density of holes the phase diagram has, with rising temperatures, a columnar crystalline phase, an Ising nematic liquid phase and a disordered fluid phase, separated by Ising continuous phase transitions. We present strong evidence for the Ising universality class of both transitions.

Experience on the DAP, especially those with only 2 Mbytes of store such as the Edinburgh DAPs, has led to thought about the detailed precisions necessary for the various calculations being done-many computers operate at an accuracy which is in excess of requirement whereas the bit-serial DAP can have its program finely tuned in accuracy. The present DAPs are far from the modern state of the art in fabrication, and future engines of similar design could be made with present technology with a rating well over a Gflop, providing very cost-effective computing.},

The Gibbs free energy difference between the phases is determined from the average force that the applied field exerts on the system. As a test system, we study the Lennard-Jones model. It is shown that the coexistence line can be computed efficiently to a high precision when the IP method is combined with the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots. Statistical and systematic errors are investigated. Advantages and drawbacks of the IP method are discussed.

abstract = {DNA molecules have been used to build a variety of nanoscale structures and devices over the past 30 years, and potential applications have begun to emerge. But the development of more advanced structures and applications will require a number of issues to be addressed, the most significant of which are the high cost of DNA and the high error rate of self-assembly. Here we examine the technical challenges in the field of structural DNA nanotechnology and outline some of the promising applications that could be developed if these hurdles can be overcome. In particular, we highlight the potential use of DNA nanostructures in molecular and cellular biophysics, as biomimetic systems, in energy transfer and photonics, and in diagnostics and therapeutics for human health.},

abstract = {Carbon-containing meteorites provide a natural sample of the extraterrestrial organic chemistry that occurred in the solar system ahead of life's origin on the Earth. Analyses of 40 years have shown the organic content of these meteorites to be materials as diverse as kerogen-like macromolecules and simpler soluble compounds such as amino acids and polyols. Many meteoritic molecules have identical counterpart in the biosphere and, in a primitive group of meteorites, represent the majority of their carbon. Most of the compounds in meteorites have isotopic compositions that date their formation to presolar environments and reveal a long and active cosmochemical evolution of the biogenic elements. Whether this evolution resumed on the Earth to foster biogenesis after exogenous delivery of meteoritic and cometary materials is not known, yet, the selective abundance of biomolecule precursors evident in some cosmic environments and the unique L-asymmetry of some meteoritic amino acids are suggestive of their possible contribution to terrestrial molecular evolution.},

The programming interface allows to implement algorithms using extensions to standard C language. With continuously increased number of cores in combination with a high memory bandwidth, a recent GPU offers incredible resources for general purpose computing. First, we apply this new technology to Monte Carlo simulations of the two dimensional ferromagnetic square lattice Ising model. By implementing a variant of the checkerboard algorithm, results are obtained up to 60 times faster on the GPU than on a current CPU core. An implementation of the three dimensional ferromagnetic cubic lattice Ising model on a GPU is able to generate results up to 35 times faster than on a current CPU core. As proof of concept we calculate the critical temperature of the 2D and 3D Ising model using finite size scaling techniques. Theoretical results for the 2D Ising model and previous simulation results for the 3D Ising model can be reproduced.},

abstract = {The observation by Ke et al. [Science 338, 1177 (2012)] that large numbers of short, pre-designed DNA strands can assemble into three-dimensional target structures came as a great surprise, as no colloidal self-assembling system has ever achieved the same degree of complexity. That failure seemed easy to rationalise: the larger the number of distinct building blocks, the higher the expected error rate for self-assembly. The experiments of Ke et al. have disproved this argument. Here, we report Monte Carlo simulations of the self-assembly of a DNA brick cube, comprising approximately 1000 types of DNA strand, using a simple model. We model the DNA strands as lattice tetrahedra with attractive patches, the interaction strengths of which are computed using a standard thermodynamic model. We find that, within a narrow temperature window, the target structure assembles with high probability. Our simulations suggest that mis-assembly is disfavoured because of a slow nucleation step. As our model incorporates no aspect of DNA other than its binding properties, these simulations suggest that, with proper design of the building blocks, other systems, such as colloids, may also assemble into truly complex structures.},

We report here a fully automated design methodology and experimental validation of synthetic RNA interaction circuits working in a cellular environment. The computational algorithm, based on a physicochemical model, produces novel RNA sequences by exploring the space of possible sequences compatible with predefined structures. We tested our methodology in Escherichia coli by designing several positive riboregulators with diverse structures and interaction models, suggesting that only the energy of formation and the activation energy (free energy barrier to overcome for initiating the hybridization reaction) are sufficient criteria to engineer RNA interaction and regulation in bacteria. The designed sequences exhibit nonsignificant similarity to any known noncoding RNA sequence. Our riboregulatory devices work independently and in combination with transcription regulation to create complex logic circuits. Our results demonstrate that a computational methodology based on first-principles can be used to engineer interacting RNAs with allosteric behavior in living cells.},

abstract = {We study the phase diagram of a binary mixture of patchy particles which has been designed to form a reversible gel. For this we perform Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermodynamics of such a system and compare our numerical results with predictions based on the analytical parameter-free Wertheim theory. We explore a wide range of the temperature-density-composition space that defines the three-dimensional phase diagram of the system. As a result, we delimit the region of thermodynamic stability of the fluid. We find that for a large range part of the phase diagram the Wertheim theory is able to give a good quantitative description of the system. For higher densities our simulations show that the system is crystallizing into a BCC structure. Finally we study the relaxation dynamics of the system by means of the density and temperature dependences of the diffusion coefficient. We show that there exists a density range where the system passes reversibly from a gel to a fluid upon both heating and cooling, encountering neither demixing nor phase separation.},

We find a peculiar shape for the vapor-liquid coexistence, featuring reentrant behavior in both phases and two critical points, despite the single-component nature of the system. The emergence of the lower critical point is caused by the self-assembly of rings taking place in the vapor, generating a phase with lower energy and lower entropy than the liquid. Monte Carlo simulations of the same model fully support these unconventional theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {New functional materials can in principle be created using colloids that self-assemble into a desired structure by means of a programmable recognition and binding scheme. This idea has been explored by attaching 'programmed' DNA strands to nanometre- and micrometre- sized particles and then using DNA hybridization to direct the placement of the particles in the final assembly. Here we demonstrate an alternative recognition mechanism for directing the assembly of composite structures, based on particles with complementary shapes. Our system, which uses Fischer's lock-and-key principle, employs colloidal spheres as keys and monodisperse colloidal particles with a spherical cavity as locks that bind spontaneously and reversibly via the depletion interaction. The lock-and-key binding is specific because it is controlled by how closely the size of a spherical colloidal key particle matches the radius of the spherical cavity of the lock particle. The strength of the binding can be further tuned by adjusting the solution composition or temperature. The composite assemblies have the unique feature of having flexible bonds, allowing us to produce flexible dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric colloidal molecules as well as more complex colloidal polymers. We expect that this lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use as a means of programming and directing colloidal self-assembly.},

By combining transmutation moves with molecular dynamics steps structural relaxations and thermal vibrations in realistic alloys can be taken into account. In this way, we construct a robust and efficient simulation technique that is ideally suited for large-scale simulations of precipitation in multicomponent systems in the presence of structural disorder. To illustrate the algorithm introduced in this work, we study the precipitation of Cu in nanocrystalline Fe.},

abstract = {We investigate the structural properties of a simple model for tetrahedral patchy colloids in which the patch width and the patch range can be tuned independently. For wide bond angles, a fully bonded network can be generated by standard Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations of the model, providing a good method for generating defect-free random tetrahedral networks. This offers the possibility of focusing on the role of the patch angular width on the structure of the fully bonded network. The analysis of the fully bonded configurations as a function of the bonding angle shows how the bonding angle controls the system compressibility, the strength of the pre-peak in the structure factor, and ring size distribution. Comparison with models of liquid water and silica allows us to find the best mapping between these continuous potentials and the colloidal one. Building on previous studies focused on the connection between angular range and crystallization, the mapping makes it possible to shed new light on the glass-forming ability of network-forming tetrahedral liquids.},

abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge over the shape of nanomaterials is a critical factor in designing devices with desired functions. Due to this reason, systematic efforts have been made to synthesize materials of diverse shape in the nanoscale regime. Anisotropic nanomaterials are a class of materials in which their properties are direction-dependent and more than one structural parameter is needed to describe them. Their unique and fine-tuned physical and chemical properties make them ideal candidates for devising new applications. In addition, the assembly of ordered one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) arrays of anisotropic nanoparticles brings novel properties into the resulting system, which would be entirely different from the properties of individual nanoparticles. This review presents an overview of current research in the area of anisotropic nanomaterials in general and noble metal nanoparticles in particular. We begin with an introduction to the advancements in this area followed by general aspects of the growth of anisotropic nanoparticles. Then we describe several important synthetic protocols for making anisotropic nanomaterials, followed by a summary of their assemblies, and conclude with major applications.},

abstract = {Complex three-dimensional biophotonic nanostructures produce the vivid structural colors of many butterfly wing scales, but their exact nanoscale organization is uncertain. We used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on single scales to characterize the 3D photonic nanostructures of five butterfly species from two families (Papilionidae, Lycaenidae). We identify these chitin and air nanostructures as single network gyroid (I4(1)32) photonic crystals. We describe their optical function from SAXS data and photonic band-gap modeling. Butterflies apparently grow these gyroid nanostructures by exploiting the self-organizing physical dynamics of biological lipid-bilayer membranes. These butterfly photonic nanostructures initially develop within scale cells as a core-shell double gyroid (Ia3d), as seen in block-copolymer systems, with a pentacontinuous volume comprised of extracellular space, cell plasma membrane, cellular cytoplasm, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) membrane, and intra-SER lumen. This double gyroid nanostructure is subsequently transformed into a single gyroid network through the deposition of chitin in the extracellular space and the degeneration of the rest of the cell. The butterflies develop the thermodynamically favored double gyroid precursors as a route to the optically more efficient single gyroid nanostructures. Current approaches to photonic crystal engineering also aim to produce single gyroid motifs. The biologically derived photonic nanostructures characterized here may offer a convenient template for producing optical devices based on biomimicry or direct dielectric infiltration.},

abstract = {Understanding the origin of cellular life on Earth requires the discovery of plausible pathways for the transition from complex prebiotic chemistry to simple biology, defined as the emergence of chemical assemblies capable of Darwinian evolution. We have proposed that a simple primitive cell, or protocell, would consist of two key components: a protocell membrane that defines a spatially localized compartment, and an informational polymer that allows for the replication and inheritance of functional information. Recent studies of vesicles composed of fatty-acid membranes have shed considerable light on pathways for protocell growth and division, as well as means by which protocells could take up nutrients from their environment. Additional work with genetic polymers has provided insight into the potential for chemical genome replication and compatibility with membrane encapsulation. The integration of a dynamic fatty-acid compartment with robust, generalized genetic polymer replication would yield a laboratory model of a protocell with the potential for classical Darwinian biological evolution, and may help to evaluate potential pathways for the emergence of life on the early Earth. Here we discuss efforts to devise such an integrated protocell model.},

@article{Schulman2012,
abstract = {Understanding how a simple chemical system can accurately replicate combinatorial information, such as a sequence, is an important question for both the study of life in the universe and for the development of evolutionary molecular design techniques. During biological sequence replication, a nucleic acid polymer serves as a template for the enzyme-catalyzed assembly of a complementary sequence. Enzymes then separate the template and complement before the next round of replication. Attempts to understand how replication could occur more simply, such as without enzymes, have largely focused on developing minimal versions of this replication process. Here we describe how a different mechanism, crystal growth and scission, can accurately replicate chemical sequences without enzymes. Crystal growth propagates a sequence of bits while mechanically-induced scission creates new growth fronts. Together, these processes exponentially increase the number of crystal sequences. In the system we describe, sequences are arrangements of DNA tile monomers within ribbon-shaped crystals. 99.98\% of bits are copied correctly and 78\% of 4-bit sequences are correct after two generations; roughly 40 sequence copies are made per growth front per generation. In principle, this process is accurate enough for 1,000-fold replication of 4-bit sequences with 50\% yield, replication of longer sequences, and darwinian evolution. We thus demonstrate that neither enzymes nor covalent bond formation are required for robust chemical sequence replication. The form of the replicated information is also compatible with the replication and evolution of a wide class of materials with precise nanoscale geometry such as plasmonic nanostructures or heterogeneous protein assemblies.},

abstract = {We report the shape and size control of polyhedral gold nanocrystals by a modified polyol process. The rapid reduction of gold precursors in refluxing 1,5-pentanediol has successfully provided a series of gold nanocrystals in the shape of octahedra, truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, cubes, and higher polygons by incremental changes of silver nitrate concentration. All nanocrystals were obtained quantitatively and were uniform in shape and size in the range of approximately 100 nm. Smaller octahedra and cubes were also prepared by using large amounts of PVP. Silver species generated from AgNO3 seemed to determine the final nanocrystal morphology by the selective growth of \{111\} and/or the restriction of \{100\}. The shape evolution of the particles was addressed by quenching the reactions at different time intervals. The approximately 60 nm seeds were generated rapidly and grown slowly with simultaneous edge sharpening. Aging the reaction mixture focused the size and shape of the nanocrystals by Ostwald ripening. We believe that our selective growth conditions can be applied to other shapes and compositions of face-centered cubic metals.},

The saddle order \$m\$ represents the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom that a static packing would possess if friction were removed. Using a novel numerical method that allows us to enumerate disk packings for each \$m\$, we show that the probability to obtain a packing with saddle order \$m\$ at a given static friction coefficient \$\backslash mu\$, \$P\_m(\backslash mu)\$, can be expressed as a power-series in \$\backslash mu\$. Using this form for \$P\_m(\backslash mu)\$, we quantitatively describe the dependence of the average contact number on friction coefficient for static disk packings obtained from direct simulations of the Cundall-Strack model for all \$\backslash mu\$ and \$N\$.},

abstract = {The mixture of 2'-5' and 3'-5' linkages generated during the nonenzymatic replication of RNA has long been regarded as a central problem for the origin of the RNA world. However, we recently observed that both a ribozyme and an RNA aptamer retain considerable functionality in the presence of prebiotically plausible levels of linkage heterogeneity. To better understand the RNA structure and function in the presence of backbone linkage heterogeneity, we obtained high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of a native 10-mer RNA duplex (1.32 \AA) and two variants: one containing one 2'-5' linkage per strand (1.55 \AA) and one containing three such linkages per strand (1.20 \AA). We found that RNA duplexes adjust their local structures to accommodate the perturbation caused by 2'-5' linkages, with the flanking nucleotides buffering the disruptive effects of the isomeric linkage and resulting in a minimally altered global structure. Although most 2'-linked sugars were in the expected 2'-endo conformation, some were partially or fully in the 3'-endo conformation, suggesting that the energy difference between these conformations was relatively small. Our structural and molecular dynamic studies also provide insight into the diminished thermal and chemical stability of the duplex state associated with the presence of 2'-5' linkages. Our results contribute to the view that a low level of 2'-5' substitution would not have been fatal in an early RNA world and may in contrast have been helpful for both the emergence of nonenzymatic RNA replication and the early evolution of functional RNAs.},

abstract = {Assembly of small building blocks such as atoms, molecules and nanoparticles into macroscopic structures--that is, 'bottom up' assembly--is a theme that runs through chemistry, biology and material science. Bacteria, macromolecules and nanoparticles can self-assemble, generating ordered structures with a precision that challenges current lithographic techniques. The assembly of nanoparticles of two different materials into a binary nanoparticle superlattice (BNSL) can provide a general and inexpensive path to a large variety of materials (metamaterials) with precisely controlled chemical composition and tight placement of the components. Maximization of the nanoparticle packing density has been proposed as the driving force for BNSL formation, and only a few BNSL structures have been predicted to be thermodynamically stable. Recently, colloidal crystals with micrometre-scale lattice spacings have been grown from oppositely charged polymethyl methacrylate spheres. Here we demonstrate formation of more than 15 different BNSL structures, using combinations of semiconducting, metallic and magnetic nanoparticle building blocks. At least ten of these colloidal crystalline structures have not been reported previously. We demonstrate that electrical charges on sterically stabilized nanoparticles determine BNSL stoichiometry; additional contributions from entropic, van der Waals, steric and dipolar forces stabilize the variety of BNSL structures.},

abstract = {We investigated the assembly of colloidal silica crystals inside double emulsion drops generated in microcapillary microfluidic devices. The double emulsions are composed of an aqueous suspension of monodisperse silica particles in the inner drop surrounded by a PDMS oil drop that acts as a semipermeable membrane for the diffusion of water into or out of the inner drop in the presence of an osmotic gradient. Imposing a high osmotic pressure in the continuous phase induces water diffusion out of the inner drop, increasing the silica volume fraction (ϕsilica) and leading to the formation of a spherical colloidal silica crystal. Silica suspensions with no salt or low salt concentration (<10(-3) M) formed colloidal crystals with ϕsilica up to 0.68. Monodisperse spherical colloidal silica crystals with sizes ranging from 16 to 133 $\mu$m were generated by varying the device geometry, flow-rate ratios, and initial silica fraction. At salt concentrations > 10(-3) M, the electrostatic repulsion is reduced, and crystallization is suppressed. Crystals were preserved in a hydrogel matrix or inside a silicone rubber shell. This study demonstrates a robust path for controlled colloidal assembly inside double emulsion drops.},

The Earth began hot after the moon-forming impact and cooled to the point where liquid water was present in approximately 10 million years. Subsequently, a few asteroid impacts may have briefly heated surface environments, leaving only thermophile survivors in kilometer-deep rocks. A warm 500 K, 100 bar CO(2) greenhouse persisted until subducted oceanic crust sequestered CO(2) into the mantle. It is not known whether the Earth's surface lingered in a approximately 70 degrees C thermophile environment well into the Archaean or cooled to clement or freezing conditions in the Hadean. Recently discovered approximately 4.3 Ga rocks near Hudson Bay may have formed during the warm greenhouse. Alkalic rocks in India indicate carbonate subduction by 4.26 Ga. The presence of 3.8 Ga black shales in Greenland indicates that S-based photosynthesis had evolved in the oceans and likely Fe-based photosynthesis and efficient chemical weathering on land. Overall, mantle derived rocks, especially kimberlites and similar CO(2)-rich magmas, preserve evidence of subducted upper oceanic crust, ancient surface environments, and biosignatures of photosynthesis.},

Within the rows of an array, nanocylinders tended to assemble such that neighboring particles had the same orientation of their segments. As a probe of interparticle interactions, we classified nanocylinder alignments by measuring the segment orientations of many sets of neighboring particles. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating an exact expression for the van der Waals (vdW) energy indicate that differences in the vdW interactions, even when small, are the key factor in producing observed segment alignment. These results point to asymmetrical vdW interactions as a potentially powerful means of controlling orientation in multicomponent cylinder arrays, and suggest that designing for these interactions could yield new ways to control self-assembly.},

abstract = {The crystallization of micrometer-sized particles with shapes mimicking those of tetrabenzoheptacene (TBH) and 1,2:5,6-dibenzanthracene (DBT), both flat polyacenes, in an electric field results in the formation of ordered 2D packings that mimic the plane group symmetries in their respective molecular crystal equivalents. Whereas the particles packed in low-density disordered arrangements under a gravitational gradient, dielectrophoresis (under an ac electric field) produced ordered high-density packings with readily identifiable plane group symmetry. The ordered colloidal assemblies were stable for hours, with the packing density decreasing slowly but with recognizable symmetry for up to 12 h for the TBH-shaped particles and up to 4 h for the DBT-shaped particles. This unexpected stability is attributed to jamming behavior associated with interlocking of the dogbone-shaped (TBH) and Z-block (DBT) particles, contrasting with the more rapid reduction of packing density and loss of hexagonal symmetry for disk-shaped particles upon removal of the electric field. The TBH-shaped and DBT-shaped particles assemble into the p2 plane group, which corresponds to the densest particle packing among the possible close-packed plane groups for these particle symmetries. The p2 symmetry observed for the TBH-shaped and DBT-shaped colloid crystal emulates the p2 symmetry of the (010) layers in their respective molecular crystals, which crystallize in monoclinic lattices. Notably, DBT-shaped particles also form ordered domains with pgg symmetry, replicating the plane group symmetry of the (100) layer in the orthorhombic polymorph of DBT. These observations illustrate that the 2D ordering of colloid particles can mimic the packing of molecules with similar shapes, demonstrating that packing can transcend length scales from the molecular to the colloidal.},

abstract = {The collective properties of nanoparticles manifest in their ability to self-organize into complex microscale structures. Slow oxidation of tellurium ions in cadmium telluride (CdTe) nanoparticles results in the assembly of 1- to 4-micrometer-long flat ribbons made of several layers of individual cadmium sulfide (CdS)/CdTe nanocrystals. Twisting of the ribbons with an equal distribution of left and right helices was induced by illumination with visible light. The pitch lengths (250 to 1500 nanometers) varied with illumination dose, and the twisting was associated with the relief of mechanical shear stress in assembled ribbons caused by photooxidation of CdS. Unusual shapes of multiparticle assemblies, such as ellipsoidal clouds, dog-bone agglomerates, and ribbon bunches, were observed as intermediate stages. Computer simulations revealed that the balance between attraction and electrostatic repulsion determines the resulting geometry and dimensionality of the nanoparticle assemblies.},

The highly ordered molecular nanostructures are comprised of a central ionic coupling motif between the anionic carboxylate moieties and Cs cations that generate distinctive chiral arrangements of the network structures. The primary electrostatic interaction results in highly flexible bond lengths and geometries. The adsorbate-substrate coupling is found to be important for the determination of the structures. With the use of rod-like carboxylic linker molecules, the dimension of the porous networks can be tuned through the variation of the aromatic backbone length.},

abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally been used in molecular modeling solely for visualization of molecular structures and animation of trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations. Modern GPUs have evolved into fully programmable, massively parallel co-processors that can now be exploited to accelerate many scientific computations, typically providing about one order of magnitude speedup over CPU code and in special cases providing speedups of two orders of magnitude. This paper surveys the development of molecular modeling algorithms that leverage GPU computing, the advances already made and remaining issues to be resolved, and the continuing evolution of GPU technology that promises to become even more useful to molecular modeling. Hardware acceleration with commodity GPUs is expected to benefit the overall computational biology community by bringing teraflops performance to desktop workstations and in some cases potentially changing what were formerly batch-mode computational jobs into interactive tasks.},

abstract = {Molecular mechanics simulations offer a computational approach to study the behavior of biomolecules at atomic detail, but such simulations are limited in size and timescale by the available computing resources. State-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) can perform over 500 billion arithmetic operations per second, a tremendous computational resource that can now be utilized for general purpose computing as a result of recent advances in GPU hardware and software architecture. In this article, an overview of recent advances in programmable GPUs is presented, with an emphasis on their application to molecular mechanics simulations and the programming techniques required to obtain optimal performance in these cases. We demonstrate the use of GPUs for the calculation of long-range electrostatics and nonbonded forces for molecular dynamics simulations, where GPU-based calculations are typically 10-100 times faster than heavily optimized CPU-based implementations. The application of GPU acceleration to biomolecular simulation is also demonstrated through the use of GPU-accelerated Coulomb-based ion placement and calculation of time-averaged potentials from molecular dynamics trajectories. A novel approximation to Coulomb potential calculation, the multilevel summation method, is introduced and compared with direct Coulomb summation. In light of the performance obtained for this set of calculations, future applications of graphics processors to molecular dynamics simulations are discussed.},

abstract = {RNA performs important cellular functions in contemporary life forms. Its ability to act both as a catalyst and a storage mechanism for genetic information is also an important part of the RNA world hypothesis. Compartmentalization within modern cells allows the local concentration of RNA to be controlled and it has been suggested that this was also important in early life forms. Here, we mimic intracellular compartmentalization and macromolecular crowding by partitioning RNA in an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). We show that the concentration of RNA is enriched by up to 3,000-fold in the dextran-rich phase of a polyethylene glycol/dextran ATPS and demonstrate that this can lead to approximately 70-fold increase in the rate of ribozyme cleavage. This rate enhancement can be tuned by the relative volumes of the two phases in the ATPS. Our observations support the importance of compartmentalization in the attainment of function in an RNA World as well as in modern biology.},

For many polymers at low to moderate concentrations the steric interactions and molecular crowding effects dominate, and the mechanism is entropic. To contrast, for many small excluded solutes, such as naturally occurring osmolytes, the mechanism is dominated by favorable enthalpy, whereas the entropic contribution is typically unfavorable.

However, under plausible prebiotic conditions, condensation of nucleobases with ribose to give beta-ribonucleosides is fraught with difficulties. The reaction with purine nucleobases is low-yielding and the reaction with the canonical pyrimidine nucleobases does not work at all. The reasons for these difficulties are considered and an alternative high-yielding synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is discussed. Fitting the new synthesis to a plausible geochemical scenario is a remaining challenge but the prospects appear good. Discovery of an improved method of purine synthesis, and an efficient means of stringing activated nucleotides together, will provide underpinning support to those theories that posit a central role for RNA in the origins of life.},

Three building units with unique atomic decorations arrange quasiperiodically and fill the space. These also serve as building units in the periodic approximant crystals. The structure is not only chemically feasible, but also provides a seamless structural understanding of the i-YbCd(5.7) phase and its series of related i-QCs and approximant crystals, revealing hierarchic features that are of considerable physical interest.},

Quasicrystals permit symmetry operations forbidden in classical crystallography, for example five-, eight-, ten- and 12-fold rotations, yet have sharp diffraction peaks. Intermetallic compounds have been observed to form both metastable and energetically stabilized quasicrystals; quasicrystalline order has also been reported for the tantalum telluride phase with an approximate Ta(1.6)Te composition. Later, quasicrystals were discovered in soft matter, namely supramolecular structures of organic dendrimers and tri-block copolymers, and micrometre-sized colloidal spheres have been arranged into quasicrystalline arrays by using intense laser beams that create quasi-periodic optical standing-wave patterns. Here we show that colloidal inorganic nanoparticles can self-assemble into binary aperiodic superlattices. We observe formation of assemblies with dodecagonal quasicrystalline order in different binary nanoparticle systems: 13.4-nm Fe(2)O(3) and 5-nm Au nanocrystals, 12.6-nm Fe(3)O(4) and 4.7-nm Au nanocrystals, and 9-nm PbS and 3-nm Pd nanocrystals. Such compositional flexibility indicates that the formation of quasicrystalline nanoparticle assemblies does not require a unique combination of interparticle interactions, but is a general sphere-packing phenomenon governed by the entropy and simple interparticle potentials. We also find that dodecagonal quasicrystalline superlattices can form low-defect interfaces with ordinary crystalline binary superlattices, using fragments of (3(3).4(2)) Archimedean tiling as the 'wetting layer' between the periodic and aperiodic phases.},

abstract = {When a system undergoes a transition from a liquid to a solid phase, it passes through multiple intermediate structures before reaching the final state. However, our knowledge on the exact pathways of this process is limited, mainly owing to the difficulty of realizing direct observations. Here, we experimentally study the evolution of symmetry and density for various colloidal systems during liquid-to-solid phase transitions, and visualize kinetic pathways with single-particle resolution. We observe the formation of relatively ordered precursor structures with different symmetries, which then convert into metastable solids. During this conversion, two major cross-symmetry pathways always occur, regardless of the final state and the interaction potential. In addition, we find a broad decoupling of density variation and symmetry development, and discover that nucleation rarely starts from the densest regions. These findings hold for all of our samples, suggesting the possibility of finding a unified picture for the complex crystallization kinetics in colloidal systems.},

abstract = {We investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties of a model of particles with \$2\$ patches of type \$A\$ and \$10\$ patches of type \$B\$. Particles are placed on the sites of a face centered cubic lattice with the patches oriented along the nearest neighbor directions. The competition between the self-assembly of chains, rings and networks on the phase diagram is investigated by carrying out a systematic investigation of this class of models, using an extension of Wertheim's theory for associating fluids and Monte Carlo numerical simulations. We varied the ratio \$r\backslash equiv\backslash epsilon\_\{AB\}/\backslash epsilon\_\{AA\}\$ of the interaction between patches \$A\$ and \$B\$, \$\backslash epsilon\_\{AB\}\$, and between \$A\$ patches, \$\backslash epsilon\_\{AA\}\$ (\$\backslash epsilon\_\{BB\}\$ is set to \$0\$) as well as the relative position of the \$A\$ patches, i.e., the angle \$\backslash theta\$ between the (lattice) directions of the \$A\$ patches. We found that both \$r\$ and \$\backslash theta\$ (\$60\^{}\backslash circ,90\^{}\backslash circ,\$ or \$120\^{}\backslash circ\$) have a profound effect on the phase diagram. In the empty fluid regime (\$r < 1/2\$) the phase diagram is re-entrant with a closed miscibility loop. The region around the lower critical point exhibits unusual structural and thermodynamic behavior determined by the presence of relatively short rings. The agreement between the results of theory and simulation is excellent for \$\backslash theta=120\^{}\backslash circ\$ but deteriorates as \$\backslash theta\$ decreases, revealing the need for new theoretical approaches to describe the structure and thermodynamics of systems dominated by small rings.},

The tile-based assembly process is a useful tool to construct large and simple structures; the DNA origami method is suitable for the production of smaller, more sophisticated and well-defined structures. Proteins, nanoparticles and other functional elements have been specifically positioned into designed patterns on these structures. They can also act as templates to study chemical reactions, help in the structural determination of proteins, and be used as platform for genomic and drug delivery applications.

Defect mobility via climbing motion is observed to be faster than glide excursions. The diffusion coefficients parallel (Dpar) and perpendicular (Dperp) to the striped nanodomains have been determined; mobility along the cylinder direction is approximately 1 order of magnitude larger than that across the cylinders. Diffusion activation energies of both motions have been extracted from variable temperature measurements of defect mobility. Additionally, disclination pairs have been observed to annihilate by emission of dislocations and the topological switching of disclination cores. These measurements of single-defect mobility in otherwise perfected nanodomain regions allow for unusually precise determination of defect mobility and energetics for both dislocation and disclination pairs in nanoconfined polymer thin film systems.

abstract = {Dense particle packings have served as useful models of the structures of liquid, glassy and crystalline states of matter, granular media, heterogeneous materials and biological systems. Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory. Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782..., 0.947..., 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids.},

abstract = {Patchy particles are a popular paradigm for the design and synthesis of nanoparticles and colloids for self-assembly. In "traditional" patchy particles, anisotropic interactions arising from patterned coatings, functionalized molecules, DNA, and other enthalpic means create the possibility for directional binding of particles into higher-ordered structures. Although the anisotropic geometry of nonspherical particles contributes to the interaction patchiness through van der Waals, electrostatic, and other interactions, how particle shape contributes entropically to self-assembly is only now beginning to be understood. The directional nature of entropic forces has recently been elucidated. A recently proposed theoretical framework that defines and quantifies directional entropic forces demonstrates the anisotropic-that is, patchy-nature of these emergent, attractive forces. Here we introduce the notion of entropically patchy particles as the entropic counterpart to enthalpically patchy particles. Using three example "families" of shapes, we show how to modify entropic patchiness by introducing geometric features to the particles via shape operations so as to target specific crystal structures assembled here with Monte Carlo simulations. We quantify the emergent entropic valence via a potential of mean force and torque. We show that these forces are on the order of a few kBT at intermediate densities below the onset of crystallization. We generalize these shape operations to shape anisotropy dimensions, in analogy with the anisotropy dimensions introduced for enthalpically patchy particles. Our findings demonstrate that entropic patchiness and emergent valence provide a way of engineering directional bonding into nanoparticle systems, whether in the presence or absence of additional, non-entropic forces.},

Colloidal particles with non-spherical shapes (such as rods and plates) are of particular interest because of their ability to form liquid crystals. Nematic liquid crystals possess orientational order; smectic and columnar liquid crystals additionally exhibit positional order (in one or two dimensions respectively). However, such positional ordering may be inhibited in polydisperse colloidal suspensions. Here we describe a suspension of plate-like colloids that shows isotropic, nematic and columnar phases on increasing the particle concentration. We find that the columnar two-dimensional crystal persists for a polydispersity of up to 25\%, with a cross-over to smectic-like ordering at very high particle concentrations.

The simulated NC superstructures are in good agreement with the experimental ones. This shows that the self-assembly process is primarily driven by minimization of the interfacial free-energies and maximization of the packing density. Our study shows that a small truncation of the hexagonal bipyramids is sufficient to change the symmetry of the resulting superlattice from hexagonal to tetragonal, highlighting the crucial importance of precise shape control in the fabrication of functional metamaterials by self-assembly of colloidal NCs.},

Meanwhile multicomponent microscopic shells buckle into various polyhedra, as observed in many organelles. Although elastic theory explains one-component icosahedral faceting, the possibility of buckling into other polyhedra has not been explored. We show here that irregular and regular polyhedra, including some Archimedean and Platonic polyhedra, arise spontaneously in elastic shells formed by more than one component. By formulating a generalized elastic model for inhomogeneous shells, we demonstrate that coassembled shells with two elastic components buckle into polyhedra such as dodecahedra, octahedra, tetrahedra, and hosohedra shells via a mechanism that explains many observations, predicts a new family of polyhedral shells, and provides the principles for designing microcontainers with specific shapes and symmetries for numerous applications in materials and life sciences.},

Ostwald ripening in such polymorphic systems is shown to result in an intrinsic focussing of the particle size distribution of the thermodynamically preferred phase while the particles of the less stable phase completely dissolve. Experimentally, a colloidal system of this kind was realized by mixing small NaEuF4 nanocrystals of the cubic $\alpha$-phase with particles of the hexagonal $\beta$-phase having the same mean size and size distribution. The temporal evolution of the particle sizes of both phases can be understood and numerically simulated within the framework of LSW theory. The simulations show that small differences in the bulk solubility or the surface energy of the two phases are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed narrowing of the particle size distribution.},

abstract = {We present a new, high-speed technique to track the three-dimensional translation and rotation of non-spherical colloidal particles. We capture digital holograms of micrometer-scale silica rods and sub-micrometer-scale Janus particles freely diffusing in water, and then fit numerical scattering models based on the discrete dipole approximation to the measured holograms. This inverse-scattering approach allows us to extract the the position and orientation of the particles as a function of time, along with static parameters including the size, shape, and refractive index. The best-fit sizes and refractive indices of both particles agree well with expected values. The technique is able to track the center of mass of the rod to a precision of 35 nm and its orientation to a precision of 1.5\$\^{}\backslash circ\$, comparable to or better than the precision of other 3D diffusion measurements on non-spherical particles. Furthermore, the measured translational and rotational diffusion coefficients for the silica rods agree with hydrodynamic predictions for a spherocylinder to within 0.3\%. We also show that although the Janus particles have only weak optical asymmetry, the technique can track their 2D translation and azimuthal rotation over a depth of field of several micrometers, yielding independent measurements of the effective hydrodynamic radius that agree to within 0.2\%. The internal and external consistency of these measurements validate the technique. Because the discrete dipole approximation can model scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles, our technique could be used in a range of applications, including particle tracking, microrheology, and fundamental studies of colloidal self-assembly or microbial motion.},

abstract = {We introduce a "virtual-move" Monte Carlo algorithm for systems of pairwise-interacting particles. This algorithm facilitates the simulation of particles possessing attractions of short range and arbitrary strength and geometry, an important realization being self-assembling particles endowed with strong, short-ranged, and angularly specific ("patchy") attractions. Standard Monte Carlo techniques employ sequential updates of particles and can suffer from low acceptance rates when attractions are strong. In this event, collective motion can be strongly suppressed. Our algorithm avoids this problem by proposing simultaneous moves of collections (clusters) of particles according to gradients of interaction energies. One particle first executes a "virtual" trial move. We determine which of its neighbors move in a similar fashion by calculating individual bond energies before and after the proposed move. We iterate this procedure and update simultaneously the positions of all affected particles. Particles move according to an approximation of realistic dynamics without requiring the explicit computation of forces and without the step size restrictions required when integrating equations of motion. We employ a size- and shape-dependent damping of cluster movements, motivated by collective hydrodynamic effects neglected in simple implementations of Brownian dynamics. We discuss the virtual-move algorithm in the context of other Monte Carlo cluster-move schemes and demonstrate its utility by applying it to a model of biological self-assembly.},

Key to the production of single twinned seeds was the addition of NaBr to a polyol synthesis in which AgNO3 is reduced by ethylene glycol in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). Examination of nanoparticles at different stages of the reaction with electron microscopy revealed that the spherical, single twinned seeds grew to become right bipyramids through enlargement of their (100) facets. The UV-vis-NIR spectrum exhibited by right bipyramids is distinct from that of any other silver nanostructure, and their sharp corners make these new nanoparticles especially promising for enhancement of Raman scattering.},

abstract = {RNA co-transcriptional folding has long been suspected to play an active role in helping proper native folding of ribozymes and structured regulatory motifs in mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs). Yet, the underlying mechanisms and coding requirements for efficient co-transcriptional folding remain unclear. Traditional approaches have intrinsic limitations to dissect RNA folding paths, as they rely on sequence mutations or circular permutations that typically perturb both RNA folding paths and equilibrium structures. Here, we show that exploiting sequence symmetries instead of mutations can circumvent this problem by essentially decoupling folding paths from equilibrium structures of designed RNA sequences. Using bistable RNA switches with symmetrical helices conserved under sequence reversal, we demonstrate experimentally that native and transiently formed helices can guide efficient co-transcriptional folding into either long-lived structure of these RNA switches. Their folding path is controlled by the order of helix nucleations and subsequent exchanges during transcription, and may also be redirected by transient antisense interactions. Hence, transient intra- and inter-molecular base pair interactions can effectively regulate the folding of nascent RNA molecules into different native structures, provided limited coding requirements, as discussed from an information theory perspective. This constitutive coupling between RNA synthesis and RNA folding regulation may have enabled the early emergence of autonomous RNA-based regulation networks.},

abstract = {It is hard to obtain spatially ordered nanostructures via the polyion complexation process due to the inherent flexibility of polymers and isotropicity of ionic interactions. Here we report the formation of polyion assemblies with well-defined, periodically regular internal structure by imparting the proper stiffness to the molecular tile. A stiff bisligand TPE-C4-L2 was designed which is able to form a negatively charged supramolecular polyelectrolyte with transition metal ions. This supramolecular polyelectrolyte slowly self-assembled into polydispersed flat sheets with cocoon-like patterns. Upon the addition of an oppositely charged ordinary polyelectrolyte, the polydispersed cocoons immediately transformed into ultralong, uniform nanoladders as a result of matched ionic density recognition. The supramolecular polyelectrolytes assembled side-by-side, and the negative charges aligned in an array. This structure forced the positively charged polymers to lie along the negative charges so that the perpendicular arrangement of the oppositely charged chains was achieved. Such precise charge recognition will provide insight into the design of advanced materials with hierarchical self-assembled structures.},

abstract = {Mixtures of anisotropic nanocrystals promise a great diversity of superlattices and phase behaviors beyond those of single-component systems. However, obtaining a colloidal shape alloy in which two different shapes are thermodynamically coassembled into a crystalline superlattice has remained a challenge. Here we present a joint experimental-computational investigation of two geometrically ubiquitous nanocrystalline building blocks-nanorods and nanospheres-that overcome their natural entropic tendency toward macroscopic phase separation and coassemble into three intriguing phases over centimeter scales, including an AB2-type binary superlattice. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that, although this shape alloy is entropically stable at high packing fraction, demixing is favored at experimental densities. Simulations with short-ranged attractive interactions demonstrate that the alloy is stabilized by interactions induced by ligand stabilizers and/or depletion effects. An asymmetry in the relative interaction strength between rods and spheres improves the robustness of the self-assembly process.},

Here, we demonstrate that illumination of dispersions of racemic CdTe NPs with right- (left-)handed circularly polarized light (CPL) induces the formation of right- (left-)handed twisted nanoribbons with an enantiomeric excess exceeding 30\%, which is ∼10 times higher than that of typical CPL-induced reactions. Linearly polarized light or dark conditions led instead to straight nanoribbons. CPL 'templating' of NP assemblies is based on the enantio-selective photoactivation of chiral NPs and clusters, followed by their photooxidation and self-assembly into nanoribbons with specific helicity as a result of chirality-sensitive interactions between the NPs. The ability of NPs to retain the polarization information of incident photons should open pathways for the synthesis of chiral photonic materials and allow a better understanding of the origins of biomolecular homochirality.},

Our findings are as follows: at low pressures, the structures almost minimizing the excluded volume (EV) generated for water molecules are stable. On the other hand, at high pressures, the structures possessing the largest possible water-accessible surface area together with sufficiently small EV become more stable. These characteristics are consistent with experimental observations.},

Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the anomalously large d spacings of the lamellar superlattices are due to a balance between depletion and electrostatic interactions, both of which arise from the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The effects of surfactant concentration, temperature, ionic strength of the solution, and prism edge length on the lattice parameters have been investigated and provide a variety of tools for in situ modulation of these colloidal superstructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a purification procedure based on our observations that can be used to efficiently separate triangular nanoprisms from spherical nanoparticles formed concomitantly during their synthesis.},

Presumably, whatever chemistry gave rise to RNA would have produced other RNA analogues, some of which may have preceded or competed directly with RNA. Threose nucleic acid (TNA), a potentially natural derivative of RNA, has received considerable interest as a possible RNA progenitor due to its chemical simplicity and ability to exchange genetic information with itself and RNA. Here, we have applied Darwinian evolution methods to evolve, in vitro, a TNA receptor that binds to an arbitrary target with high affinity and specificity. This demonstration shows that TNA has the ability to fold into tertiary structures with sophisticated chemical functions, which provides evidence that TNA could have served as an ancestral genetic system during an early stage of life.},

abstract = {Earth is the one known example of an inhabited planet and to current knowledge the likeliest site of the one known origin of life. Here we discuss the origin of Earth's atmosphere and ocean and some of the environmental conditions of the early Earth as they may relate to the origin of life. A key punctuating event in the narrative is the Moon-forming impact, partly because it made Earth for a short time absolutely uninhabitable, and partly because it sets the boundary conditions for Earth's subsequent evolution. If life began on Earth, as opposed to having migrated here, it would have done so after the Moon-forming impact. What took place before the Moon formed determined the bulk properties of the Earth and probably determined the overall compositions and sizes of its atmospheres and oceans. What took place afterward animated these materials. One interesting consequence of the Moon-forming impact is that the mantle is devolatized, so that the volatiles subsequently fell out in a kind of condensation sequence. This ensures that the volatiles were concentrated toward the surface so that, for example, the oceans were likely salty from the start. We also point out that an atmosphere generated by impact degassing would tend to have a composition reflective of the impacting bodies (rather than the mantle), and these are almost without exception strongly reducing and volatile-rich. A consequence is that, although CO- or methane-rich atmospheres are not necessarily stable as steady states, they are quite likely to have existed as long-lived transients, many times. With CO comes abundant chemical energy in a metastable package, and with methane comes hydrogen cyanide and ammonia as important albeit less abundant gases.},

abstract = {We construct schemes for self-replicating clusters of spherical particles, validated with computer simulations in a finite-temperature heat bath. Each particle has stickers uniformly distributed over its surface, and the rules for self-replication are encoded into the specificity and strength of interactions. Geometrical constraints imply that a compact cluster can copy itself only with help of a catalyst, a smaller cluster that increases the surface area to form a template. Replication efficiency requires optimizing interaction energies to destabilize all kinetic traps along the reaction pathway, as well as initiating a trigger event that specifies when the new cluster disassociates from its parent. Although there is a reasonably wide parameter range for self-replication, there is a subtle balance between the speed of the reaction, and the error rate. As a proof of principle, we construct interactions that self-replicate an octahedron, requiring a two-particle dimer for a catalyst. The resulting self-replication scheme is a hypercycle, and computer simulations confirm the exponential growth of both octahedron and catalyst replicas.},

Through simulations we show that structures with highly variable shapes made out of dozens of particles can form with high yield, as long as each particle in the structure binds only to the particles in their local environment. To understand this, we identify the excited states that compete with the ground-state structure and demonstrate that these excited states have a completely topological characterization, valid when the interparticle interactions are short-ranged. This allows complete enumeration of the energy landscape and gives bounds on how large a colloidal structure can assemble with high yield. For large structures the yield can be significant, even with hundreds of particles.},

The most common recognition motifs involve biological macromolecules such as antibodies and aptamers. The key to biorecognition consists of a unique three-dimensional structure formed by a folded and constrained bioheteropolymer that creates a binding pocket, or an interface, able to recognize a specific molecule. Here, we show that synthetic heteropolymers, once constrained onto a single-walled carbon nanotube by chemical adsorption, also form a new corona phase that exhibits highly selective recognition for specific molecules. To prove the generality of this phenomenon, we report three examples of heteropolymer-nanotube recognition complexes for riboflavin, L-thyroxine and oestradiol. In each case, the recognition was predicted using a two-dimensional thermodynamic model of surface interactions in which the dissociation constants can be tuned by perturbing the chemical structure of the heteropolymer. Moreover, these complexes can be used as new types of spatiotemporal sensors based on modulation of the carbon nanotube photoemission in the near-infrared, as we show by tracking riboflavin diffusion in murine macrophages.},

abstract = {Assemblies of disordered nanoparticles constitute an important class of materials that have numerous applications in energy conversion and storage, electronics, photonics, and sensing. One major roadblock that limits the widespread utilization of disordered nanoparticle assemblies (DNAs) is their poor damage tolerance; they fracture under small loads and, thus, have low toughness. The absence of fundamental understanding on the mechanical behavior and failure mechanism of disordered nanoparticle assemblies makes it even more challenging to develop new strategies to toughen these structures without compromising their mechanical strength. Here we show the formation of shear bands, highly localized regions of mechanical strain that prelude fracture, in disordered assemblies of spherical nanoparticles, which bear striking resemblance to the deformation mechanism of a different class of disordered materials, metallic glasses. We demonstrate that anisotropic nanoparticles greatly suppress shear band formation and toughen nanoparticle packings without sacrificing their strength, implying that tuning constituent anisotropy can be used to enhance toughness in disordered packings of nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Self-replication is a ubiquitous process in organisms. Understanding the key ingredients of self-replication is critical for developing self-sustaining systems in the laboratory. Moreover, finding the optimal conditions to generate accurate replicas and adequate output can accelerate industrial processes enormously. Here, we propose a scheme for self-replication where asymmetric interactions in colloids are used to find optimal self-replication conditions by controlling the input of energy. We generalize a recently developed kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to treat both translational and rotational motions of Brownian anisotropic colloids. We report two main findings from our simulations: first, by fine tuning the particle interactions, highly accurate self-replication is achievable with a moderate sacrifice of reaction speed. Second, with the introduction of energy cycling to enable periodic assembly/disassembly of the system's components the replicator population grows exponentially. The exponential growth constant is a non-monotonic function of the period of the pulsed energy delivery.},

abstract = {Self-replication is a remarkable phenomenon in nature that has fascinated scientists for decades. In a self-replicating system, the original units are attracted to a template, which induce their binding. In equilibrium, the energy required to disassemble the newly assembled copy from the mother template is supplied by thermal energy. The possibility of optimizing self-replication was explored by controlling the frequency at which energy is supplied to the system. A model system inspired by a class of light-switchable colloids was considered where light is used to control the interactions. Conditions under which self-replication can be significantly more effective under non-equilibrium, cyclic energy delivery than under equilibrium constant energy conditions were identified. Optimal self-replication does not require constant energy expenditure. Instead, the proper timing at which energy is delivered to the system is an essential controllable parameter to induce high replication rates.},

We simulate a system of model hard particles with attractive patches and show that they can self-assemble into a diamond structure from an initially disordered state. We quantify the extent to which the formation of the diamond structure can be facilitated by "seeding" the system with small diamond crystallites or by introducing a rotation interaction to mimic a carbon-carbon antibonding interaction. Our results suggest patchy particles may serve as colloidal "atoms" and "molecules" for the bottom-up self-assembly of three-dimensional crystals.},

Strikingly, phases having fourfold symmetry are not observed at any $\Phi$(A). The rhombic lattice angle $\alpha$ increases continuously with $\Phi$(A), as the system maximizes its total rotational and translational entropy. A cage model, based on packing rotationally swept squares, or "squaroids," reasonably predicts the measured $\alpha$($\Phi$(A)), indicating that rotational entropy and the square particle shape combine to produce the rhombic unit cell.},

Here we observe and explain the origin of local chiral symmetry breaking in a surprisingly simple system of hard Brownian particles: achiral regular triangles confined to two dimensions. Using enhanced optical video particle-tracking microscopy, we show that microscale lithographic triangular platelets form two different triatic liquid crystal phases. Above a particle area fraction $\phi$(A)≈0.55, the simple triatic phase is spatially disordered, yet has molecular orientational characteristics that distinguish it from a hexatic liquid crystal. At higher $\phi$(A)≥0.61, we find a second triatic phase exhibiting local chiral symmetry breaking; rotational entropy favours laterally offsetting the positions of nearest-neighbouring triangles. By contributing to spatial disordering, local chiral symmetry breaking can limit the range of shapes that can be entropically crystallized.},

abstract = {Collective motion of self-propelled organisms or synthetic particles, often termed "active fluid," has attracted enormous attention in the broad scientific community because of its fundamentally nonequilibrium nature. Energy input and interactions among the moving units and the medium lead to complex dynamics. Here, we introduce a class of active matter--living liquid crystals (LLCs)--that combines living swimming bacteria with a lyotropic liquid crystal. The physical properties of LLCs can be controlled by the amount of oxygen available to bacteria, by concentration of ingredients, or by temperature. Our studies reveal a wealth of intriguing dynamic phenomena, caused by the coupling between the activity-triggered flow and long-range orientational order of the medium. Among these are (i) nonlinear trajectories of bacterial motion guided by nonuniform director, (ii) local melting of the liquid crystal caused by the bacteria-produced shear flows, (iii) activity-triggered transition from a nonflowing uniform state into a flowing one-dimensional periodic pattern and its evolution into a turbulent array of topological defects, and (iv) birefringence-enabled visualization of microflow generated by the nanometers-thick bacterial flagella. Unlike their isotropic counterpart, the LLCs show collective dynamic effects at very low volume fraction of bacteria, on the order of 0.2\%. Our work suggests an unorthodox design concept to control and manipulate the dynamic behavior of soft active matter and opens the door for potential biosensing and biomedical applications.},

abstract = {Photonic crystals are attracting current interest for a variety of reasons, such as their ability to inhibit the spontaneous emission of light. This and related properties arise from the formation of photonic bandgaps, whereby multiple scattering of photons by lattices of periodically varying refractive indices acts to prevent the propagation of electromagnetic waves having certain wavelengths. One route to forming photonic crystals is to etch two-dimensional periodic lattices of vertical air holes into dielectric slab waveguides. Such structures can show complete photonic bandgaps, but only for large-diameter air holes in materials of high refractive index (such as gallium arsenide, n = 3.69), which unfortunately leads to significantly reduced optical transmission when combined with optical fibres of low refractive index. It has been suggested that quasicrystalline (rather than periodic) lattices can also possess photonic bandgaps. Here we demonstrate this concept experimentally and show that it enables complete photonic bandgaps--non-directional and for any polarization--to be realized with small air holes in silicon nitride (n = 2.02), and even glass (n = 1.45). These properties make photonic quasicrystals promising for application in a range of optical devices.},

However, when packing spatially extended objects with flexible shapes, additional concepts must be invoked to understand the stability of the resulting structure. Here, we examine the disordered packing of chains constructed out of flexibly connected hard spheres. Using x-ray tomography, we find that long chains pack into a low-density structure whose mechanical rigidity is mainly provided by the backbone. On compaction, randomly oriented, semi-rigid loops form along the chain, and the packing of chains can be understood as the jamming of these elements. Finally, we uncover close similarities between the packing of chains and the glass transition in polymers.},
